                "text": "With the allied forces invading France from both the East and the South-West, Napoleon was forced to abdicate by the Senate in the spring of 1814. He signed his act of abdication 11 April 1814. Under the treaty of Fontainebleau, he was given sovereignty over the island of Elba and arrived there 3 May 1814. \r\n\r\nA few weeks later, a satirical print was published of Napoleon as Robinson Crusoe. In the print, Napoleon is wearing a lion skin and holding an umbrella which bears a golden imperial eagle on the top. The image bears striking resemblance to an earlier print of the lead actor in an 1805 melodrama by Pixerécourt which was based on Defoe's famous novel. The first appearance of the character on the stage at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin had caused a sensation but the echoing of that performance in the political satire is perhaps surprising. The use of a theatrical reference point – that of a melodrama from 9 years before – is a reminder of how closely entwined culture and politics were during the First Empire.\r\n\r\nClick below if you want to find out more about the link between the two prints.",

                "text": "The melodrama \"Robinson Crusoe\" had swept Paris by storm when it premiered – contemporary accounts mention how discussion about the play had filled the press for weeks before the first performance and the opening night was a huge success for Pixerécourt who was, at the time, the leading French playwright. <br /><br />That a satirical political print in 1814 might make reference to a melodrama from almost a decade earlier might seem surprising but it reveals the extent to which successful melodramas infiltrated public consciousness and reinforces a recurrent discourse amongst restoration critics linking the genre to the Napoleonic regime. <br /><br />Whilst modern critics often use theatrical metaphor when discussing Napoleon – Dominique de Villepin’s account of the 100 days is a good example – those who proclaimed themselves against Napoleon and for the restoration of the monarchy in 1814 and in 1815 likened Napoleon to a character in a melodrama. So, for instance, in Martainville’s play \"Buonaparte ou l’abus de l’abdication\" (Buonaparte or abusing abdication) (1815), the Emperor is presented as using the language of melodrama to inflame the people into supporting him once more (act 1, scene 9). <br /><br />Similarly, Hapdé, in his treatise ‘Plus de mélodrames’ (1814) says that now that the people of France have ousted Napoleon, it is time to oust melodrama too, thereby explicitly linking the Emperor with the Empire’s most successful theatrical form. <br /><br />Nevertheless, the image of Napoleon as Robinson Crusoe does not portray him as melodrama villain (and there were no shortage of those!) but as the hero of one of the most successful plays of the period. The print’s satirical intent is undercut by this. <br /><br />The possibility of reading the print either as negative or nostalgic representation of the former Emperor is extended when the caption to the original print is considered. The 1805 print includes a line from early in the play – it was customary for prints of actors representing characters from plays to include a line of text representing a particular moment in the performance – and the line is not without ambiguity when placed alongside the Napoleonic image. The caption reads ‘relève-toi: ce n’est que devant Dieu que l’homme doit s’humilier (\"get back on your feet: it is only before God that man should humble himself\")’.<br /><br />In the context of May 1814 when the Napoleonic Robinson print is published, the caption recalled by the similarities between the two prints can either be a suggestion of a new-found humility, as it was for the character in the Pixerécourt play, or an indication of Napoleon’s over-inflated sense of his own importance. Thus the print can bear opposing meanings – a technique often used by print makers to increase potential sales.",

He had then taken the road south to his new domain. Refusing an escort of enemy troops, he was accompanied only by the members of his own household, and four commissioners representing Austria, Russia, Prussia and England. As he entered Provence, Napoleon's reception became alarmingly hostile. The region had a strong royalist and Catholic tradition, and had suffered from years of wartime conscription and high taxation. On the 25th April, popular anger reached its peak as Napoleon passed through the village of Orgon near Avignon. A large and menacing crowd hanged him in effigy, and pressed up against the windows of his carriage shouting abuse. Without the timely intervention of the Russian commissioner, Napoleon could easily have been lynched. As it was, he was terrified, and quickly donned the Austrian commissioner's shako and cloak to escape recognition. The scene, with Napoleon cowering in his carriage in his Austrian disguise, is depicted here in a contemporary German print. Quaintly, it has made no effort to show Orgon as a Provençal village, but has made it a German one instead, complete with onion-domed church. Apart from threatening Napoleon's life, the incident at Orgon played a major part in shaping the Hundred Days. When planning his return to France from Elba in the spring of 1815, Napoleon was determined to bypass Provence, where he had so narrowly escaped death, even though it provided the most direct route to Paris. Instead, he chose the remote, sparsely populated mountain path from the coast via Grenoble, which has gone down in history as the Route Napoléon.",

                "text": "To find out more about Napoleon in 1814, see Munro Price, Napoleon: The End of Glory (OUP, 2014) which tells the story of the dramatic two years that led to Napoleon's abdication in April 1814. Though crucial to European history, they remain strangely neglected, lying between the two much better-known landmarks of the retreat from Moscow and the battle of Waterloo. Yet this short period saw both Napoleon's loss of his European empire, and of his control over France itself. In 1813 the massive battle of Leipzig - the bloodiest in modern history before the first day of the Somme - forced his armies back to the Rhine. The next year, after a brilliant campaign against overwhelming odds, Napoleon was forced to abdicate and exiled to Elba. He regained his throne the following year, for just a hundred days, in a doomed adventure whose defeat at Waterloo was predictable. \r\n\r\nThe most fascinating - and least-known - aspect of these years is that at several key points Napoleon's enemies offered him peace terms that would have allowed him to keep his throne, if not his empire, a policy inspired by the brilliant and devious Austrian foreign minister Metternich. Napoleon: The End of Glory sheds fascinating new light on Napoleon, Metternich, and many other key figures and events in this dramatic period of European history, drawing on previously unused archives in France, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Through these it seeks to answer the most important question of all - why, instead of accepting a compromise, Napoleon chose to gamble on total victory at the risk of utter defeat?",

He is raising troops by the usual method of drawing a number, although the minimum height of the soldier had to be 1.54m. Potential recruits fell into three categories: 1) fit to march, 2) suitable without exemption, 3) suitable with exemption.\r\nAll this can be seen in the caricature where tuna are acting as soldiers: fish that draw their number are then being measured, with one of them having a right to exemption by showing a paper proving epilepsy. Some fish are being drilled, marching behind Napoleon and carrying a flag.\r\n\tNapoleon really did enlist soldiers on Elba and tried to raise others on the Italian mainland to supplement the veterans who had joined him in exile, but the print is probably chiefly an ironic comment on his incorrigible militarism. Similar prints later showed him training rats on Saint Helena.\r\n",

                "text": "During the Empire very few satirical prints of Napoleon appeared in France but print makers took full advantage of the First Restoration to depict the former Emperor in exile. \r\nThis anonymous graphic satire, entitled ‘Nicolas Philoctète dans l’Ile d’Elbe (n’a jamais passé la Manche’) depicts Napoleon as the ancient Greek hero Philoctetes, dwelling in latter-day exile on the island of Elba. Here, wearing laurels, military uniform and an imperial cape, yet with his right arm curiously sleeveless and a crudely fashioned sandal on his left foot, the fallen warrior is shown with a bandage on his left ankle, a bleeding wound clearly displayed on the corresponding calf, in the act of claiming a white bird from the branch of a nearby tree in which a snake can be seen lurking within the foliage. The bow and quiver of arrows implies that the bird, possibly a white stork, symbolic of peace, has recently been shot by this composite figure. The detail of the rolled-up sleeve together with the print’s subtitle, N’a jamais passé la Manche, meaning either ‘always sleeveless’ or ‘never crossed the English Channel’, could be read as a sly commentary on the Emperor’s failure to fulfil his historical destiny. The derogatory use of ‘Nicolas’ in the title, which recalls the chants of the crowds in Avignon as Napoleon made his way to Fréjus to set sail for Elba (‘A bas Nicolas! A bas le tyran, le coquin, l’assassin des Français, le mauvais gueux!’), serves also to deflate the comparison between the Corsican usurper and the ancient Greek hero.\r\n",

Drawing on a range of approaches it aims to redefine the Romantic period as an age of inter- and intra-national conflict, thus overturning conventional notions of 'The Romantic Project', and re-writing the period from first principles. Topics covered include: the impact of Waterloo on Romantic ideas of individual and national identity, the representation of the dead and wounded in poetry, painting and prose, the work of canonical and non-canonical poets.",

The recipient, Vincenzo Vantini, a member of the Elban nobility, had been one of Napoleon’s Chamberlains during his 10-month reign over the island. The records of the Muncipality of Portoferraio provide an account of Napoleon’s departure from Elba, written by the mayor, Traditi.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Guard began to embark at 2 in the afternoon. The Island’s civil authorities were then summoned to Napoleon’s palace at 6 in the evening to be informed of his departure. Both Mayor Traditi and Guillaume Peyrusse, Napoleon’s treasurer, record that Napoleon expressed satisfaction with those who had helped run the Island during his stay and it is at this point presumably that he offered tokens of his gratitude - such as this watch - to those who had served him well. Secret preparations for the departure had been underway since 16 February when Napoleon received news that the Congress of Vienna was considering changing his place of exile to somewhere much more remote. The convenient absence of the English Commander Colonel Neil Campbell, who was on Elba to monitor Napoleon but away in Italy between 17 and 28 February, made the preparations easier.\r\n\r\nNapoleon left his palace at 7pm and made his way to the port surrounded by weeping Elbans, if we are to believe Pons de l’Hérault’s moving account of his departure in his Mémoires.\r\n\r\nThe flotilla, with Napoleon on board the brig the Inconstant, set sail at 8pm.\r\n",

At the time, however, the enterprise was by no means certain of success. \r\n\r\n Napoleon’s flotilla consisted of the ‘Inconstant’, a 2-masted brig with 26 canons, the French brig the ‘St Esprit’, commandeered for the expedition, the Emperor’s own 3-masted xebec the ‘Etoile’, a 1-masted sailing ship, the ‘Caroline’, and 3 smaller vessels. \r\n\r\nThe expedition did not begin auspiciously: barely out of Portoferraio, they were becalmed and by dawn had only travelled 6 leagues. The wind picked up, however, and on 27th they survived passing close by a French ship, the ‘Zéphir’, without being recognised. In his account of the crossing from Elba to the French coast, Monier recounts how the captain of the ‘Zéphir’, realising that the ‘Inconstant’ had come from Elba, asked how the Emperor was doing. The reply came back: ‘Marvellously’. \r\n\r\nMonier also recounts how anyone who could read and write was pressed into action copying out the two proclamations Napoleon had prepared, one for the army, one for the people of France, which would be distributed once they landed on French soil.",

They attacked royalists by portraying them as partisans of a caricatural ancien régime which was systematically linked to the nobility who had returned from emigration and to the clergy. \r\n\r\nThe \"Nain Jaune\" was the wittiest of these newspapers and stands out because it published caricatures, some of which became, in due course, part and parcel of French cultural memory. The print ‘The Reception of a New Member of the Order of the Extinguishers’, which appeared 15 February 1815, refers to the creation of an invented ‘dark order of the Extinguishers’ whose extravagant statutes were published in the newspaper from 5 January onwards. These were modelled on those of real royalist secret societies such as the Order of the Faith founded by Ferdinand de Bertier during the Empire. This piece of satire in the 'Nain Jaune' is aimed directly at extreme royalists who criticised in the name of divine right the constitutional Charter of Louis XVIII and who attacked the principles of the Revolution, especially the notion of equality.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "The print is based on the traditional opposition between shadow and light, representing respectively the ancien régime and the Revolution. So we see the symbol of the extinguisher, the order’s coat of arms bearing a bat, the orchestra of blind musicians in the background, and the ‘Chant des ténèbres’ (Song of Darkness) which refers to the Catholic liturgy of Holy Week before Easter. In the statutes we are told that since that the aim of the order is ‘the extinction of light: none may be admitted without being able to prove four generations of ignorance on both the paternal and maternal side’ (article 7). The 'Nain Jaune', which was founded by former Bonapartists converted to liberalism, is here anticipating the speeches of Revolutionary propaganda that Napoleon would deliver on his return from Elba and on the route to Paris. \r\n\r\nIn this game of mirrors, two different visions of France, that of the ancien régime and that of the Revolution, are once again pitted against each other, as they would be for the rest of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis entry was written in French. To read it in the original French, please see below.\r\n\r\nLégende du nain jaune\r\n\r\nDans les mois qui ont précédé le retour de Napoléon au pouvoir en mars 1815, quelques journaux échappés à la censure relativement bienveillante des Bourbons ont indirectement préparé le terrain des Cent Jours en prenant une tournure délibérément libérale et en attaquant les partisans d’un ancien régime plus fantasmé que réel, systématiquement assimilé à la noblesse émigrée et au clergé. Le Nain jaune est le plus spirituel d’entre eux. Il a cette particularité de publier des caricatures dont certaines sont restées en France dans toutes les mémoires. La « Réception d’un chevalier de l’éteignoir » qui paraît le 15 février 1815 renvoie à la création fictive de « l’ordre sombre de l’éteignoir » dont les statuts rocambolesques ont été publiés par le journal dès le 5 janvier, sur le modèle des sociétés secrètes royalistes, comme celle des Chevaliers de la foi fondée par Ferdinand de Bertier sous l’Empire.  Les royalistes exagérés qui critiquent la Charte constitutionnelle octroyée par Louis XVIII au nom du droit divin et attaquent les principes de la Révolution, à commencer par l’égalité, sont ici directement visés. Tout repose sur l’opposition classique de l’ombre et de la lumière qui figurent alternativement l’ancien régime et la révolution : le symbole de l’éteignoir, les armes de l’ordre ornées d’une chauve souris, l’orchestre des aveugles (au second plan), le « Chant des ténèbres » qui renvoie à la liturgie catholique de la Semaine sainte. « L’ordre, lit-on dans les statuts, ayant pour but l’extinction des lumières, nul ne pourra y être admis sans avoir fait preuve de quatre générations d’ignorance paternelle et maternelle » (article 7).  Le Nain jaune fondé par d’anciens bonapartistes reconvertis au libéralisme anticipe les discours de propagande révolutionnaire que tiendra Napoléon à son retour de l’île d’Elbe sur la route de Paris. Dans ce jeux de miroirs et de représentations, deux Frances se retrouvent à nouveau face à face : celle de l’ancien régime et celle de la révolution. Ce sera toute l’histoire du XIXe siècle français.\r\n",

                "text": "Napoleon landed on the South French coast at the small fishing port of Golfe-Juan during the afternoon of 1 March 1815. His propaganda machine sprang into action immediately. \r\n\r\nNapoleon had always been a master of spin. The numerous proclamations and declarations issued throughout the Empire reveal an Emperor always able to inspire people through powerful and emotive appeals to the nation. \r\n\r\nPrepared in advance and copied on board the brig the ‘Inconstant’ during the crossing, the proclamations dated 1 March 1815 at Golfe-Juan are typical of his style. Napoleon issued two proclamations: to the people and to the army. The officers of the Imperial Guard issued their own, addressed to the generals and officers of the army.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s proclamation to the army (shown here) is more stirring than his one to the people – Napoleon knew he needed the army to come back over to him if his venture were to succeed. He tried to rally the soldiers by representing them as liberators of France, making much of the need for French self-determination, and he called on the army to shape the future of the nation. He instructed every man to cast off the white colours of the royal family and return to the French Revolutionary tricolour cockade. In a sentence which instantly became iconic, he declared:\r\n\r\nLa victoire marchera aux pas de charge; l'aigle avec les couleurs nationales, volera de clocher en clocher jusqu'aux tours de Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\n(Victory shall march in double quick time; the eagle bearing the colours of the nation will fly from steeple to steeple until it reaches the towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral.)\r\n",

He presented himself as having had to sacrifice his personal glory for the good of the nation:\r\n\r\nJe ne consultai que l'intérêt de la patrie; je m'exilai sur un rocher au milieu des mers.\r\n\r\n(I consulted only the interests of the nation; I took myself into exile on a rock in the middle of the sea.)\r\n\r\nHe presented his return to France in similar terms; he was back because the nation needed a legitimate sovereign of its own choosing. He tells the people of France that he has heard their complaints about Louis XVIII, and that he has risked life and limb on a perilous crossing to save the interests of France...\r\n\r\nThe Niles’ Weekly register (Baltimore) translates both proclamations in full in its weekly register of foreign news dated Saturday 6th May (available on google books, volume VIII, pp. 163-64). News had first reached Baltimore, via New York, on Friday 28th April, too late for anything other than a brief account in the paper for Saturday 29th April but treated in full in the issue on 6th May.\r\n",

Two of the figures on the balcony wear extinguishers as hats, marking them out as members of the Order of the Extinguishers (for more on the Order, see yesterday’s entry by Emmanuel de Waresquiel on the pages of 'Le Nain Jaune' newspaper). \r\n\r\nThe print might have been created in response to an anti-Napoleon print published in 1814, ‘Du haut en bas’ (from on high to down low), which depicts Napoleon over-stretched between Madrid and Moscow. After the 100 days, more caricatures make use of the leitmotif, including ‘Le dernier élan d’un grand homme’ in which Napoleon, dressed as Pierrot, goes into exile, leaping from the ‘Bellérophon’ to the ‘Northumberland’ without waiting for a ladder. \r\n\r\nEnjambées were a leitmotif long before Napoleon entered the scene; the print recalls two French Revolutionary prints in which women, Marie-Antoinette and Catherine II, are portrayed taking a stride to escape or conquer. The Revolutionary connotations are rather more negative, however, representing an opportunity to make light of these women’s sexuality by having the crowned heads of Europe look up their skirts.",

The golden eagle at the top of the ship’s mast assumes flesh and blood and takes flight, the imperial crown on its head, in its beak the Legion d’Honneur ‘for the brave’ followers of the returning emperor, and laurel and oak leaves, symbolic of peace and power, in its talons. It is accompanied by a smaller eagle, standing for Napoleon’s son, the King of Rome, and the security of the dynasty.<br /><br /> Swarming bees, recalling those that had been adopted for Bonapartian regalia and embroidered in gold across Napoleon’s coronation mantle, escort the eagles as they cross over into France. Below, the trunks of an orchard of pomegranate trees – <em>grenadiers,  </em>a reference to the faithful Imperial Guard – appear, anthropomorphically, to march as the eagles progress northwards. <br /><br />A menagerie of frogs, snakes, turkeys and geese, all symbolic by means of their own negative connotations of royalist courtiers, flees its airborne pursuers in the direction of the Channel at the left of the image. In the chaos, white lilies, emblems of the Bourbon dynasty, are crushed underfoot, making way for the inexorable carpet of violets – popular harbinger of Napoleon’s escape from Elba – sweeping across the country.",

Today’s entry is a reminder that while Napoleon was adding a new chapter to the history books, Parisian cultural life was still being influenced by the influx of British visitors who had arrived on the Continent after the Emperor had been sent into exile. Plays, prints and novels of the first Restoration of 1814-15 had taken full advantage of the comic potential of the new arrivals...<br /><br />‘The English at my Aunt’s in Brussels’ was published on 4 March 1815 and followed on 11 March by a companion print, ‘Divertissement des Anglais en Belgique ou le Soupé chez Mamour’. The French artist, Jean-Baptiste Genty, was a pupil of the more famous Jacques-Louis David, and exhibited miniatures. He published a large number of prints during 1815, both for and against Napoleon, including a substantial number with English themes. This print shows three English officers visiting a brothel in Brussels, the 'aunt' of the title. A British army had moved into the Netherlands in December 1813 to support the revolt against Napoleon and had remained there to help enforce the unification of Belgium with Holland as the United Netherlands, an arrangement to which most Belgians were hostile.",

It consisted of volunteers who had served in the regiment of Polish chevau-légers formed in Warsaw in 1807; the regiment had accompanied Napoleon in all subsequent campaigns until his abdication as part of the Imperial Guard. \r\n\r\nKnown for its courage and combat values, the Polish light-horse regiment gained military glory in many battles including Somosierra (1808), where Napoleon and his Old Guard honored them as “braves des braves”, Wagram (1809) and many others in 1812-1814. \r\n\r\nIn 1812 Polish chevau-légers guarded Napoleon during his retreat from Russia. The Polish chevau-légers were just a small percentage of the Poles fighting under the Napoleonic eagle – in 1812 the army of the Duchy of Warsaw and Polish troops in the French service numbered about 100,000. Nevertheless in the opinion of many Poles it was the chevau-légers – closely connected with the person of Emperor of the French – who were to be the representative of Polish national aspirations for the reconstruction of the Polish state under Napoleon’s protection.\r\n\r\nAfter Napoleon’s abdication (6 April 1814), Tsar Alexander I decided to enlarge the Russian sphere of influence in Europe, taking upon himself the role of protecting Polish national aspirations. With the permission of the Russian ruler several thousands of Polish soldiers who had fought alongside Napoleon to the very end returned to the Duchy of Warsaw. However on Napoleon’s request, Major Paweł Jerzmanowski chose from the chevau-légers 125 volunteers who decided to follow the Emperor into his exile on Elba.\r\n\r\n In 1815 the Elba squadron assisted Napoleon in his triumphant return from Elba to Paris. Although the Grand Duke Constantin, who was commanding the Polish army on behalf of his brother Alexander I called for the chevau-légers to return immediately to the country, Jerzmanowski ignored the order. The squadron was even enlarged by other Polish volunteers, reaching 225 cavalrymen.\r\n\r\nThe unit took part in the battle of Quatre Bras (15 June), and during the battle of Waterloo (18 June) they successfully repelled the charge of Ponsonby’s cavalry brigade. \r\n\r\nThe squadron was disbanded after Napoleon’s second abdication. The chevau-légers’s involvement at Elba contributed to the strength of the Napoleonic legend in Poland; in Polish collective memory across the 19th and 20th centuries, they stood as a symbol of the soldiers’ fidelity and political hopes for regaining Poland independence in alliance with one of the great powers of Western Europe.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "“Alte Liebe rostet nicht” (an old flame never dies)\r\n\r\nPrint-makers and cartoonists were on the front-line of the propaganda war sparked by Napoleon's escape from Elba. With Napoleon back in power, the Allies began to worry that the German states in the Confederation of the Rhine (who had thrown in their lot with Napoleon after his victory at Austerlitz in 1806) would once again rally to his cause. Plenty of German functionaries had Bonapartist sympathies. Were they to change sides, Napoleon would prove much harder to defeat.\r\n\r\nThis print, now in the Eton College collection, was made in Germany, presumably soon after March 1815. A dancing Napoleon is shown brandishing a laurel wreath and tambourine as, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, he leads a procession of those German functionaries over a cliff into a fiery abyss.\r\n\r\n First in line is a figure representing the Minister of Finance hauling sacks labelled Sweat and Blood. After him, come the Gendarmerie; the Mistresses of the powerful; a Sovereign Prince on a hobby horse led by his tutor; a Secret Policeman wearing donkey's ears (all the better to eavesdrop on dissenters) and the Universities. Bringing up the rear is a trumpeter: the label 'the Official Leaf’ attached to him suggests that he represents the German states’ own pro-Bonaparte propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn the background, the ladder of the man apparently switching the loyalties of the German states is annotated with a reminder of the thousands of Germans who died fighting on Napoleon’s side at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and with a reference to the Treaty of Luneville by which the Low Countries had surrendered to French control in 1801. To emphasise still further the folly of backing the Emperor, the cartoonist draws a miserable figure huddled in the gutter, representing the suffering of ordinary people. He seems to be warning that this will be the fate of the German people if they allow their foolish leaders once more to fall into line behind Napoleon.\r\n",

                "text": "The hostility of the people of Provence in 1814 (see Munro Price’s entry for 26 February) had forced Napoleon to find an alternative route to Paris. The route he took became France’s first official tourist route in 1932 but long before then, from as early as May 1815, locations of significance were marked and can still be found. \r\n\r\nThus there are traces of the Eagle’s flight north in Grasse (reached 2 March), Castellane and Barrême (3 March), Digne (4 March), Gap (5 March) and Laffrey (6 March).\r\n\r\nWhile most of the towns and villages along the route have columns, or plaques, at Laffrey there is a statue of Napoleon on horseback, commemorating one of the most significant moments of the march on Paris:  the moment when royalist troops sent to stop him instead went over to his side.\r\n\r\n From Laffrey, Napoleon headed to Grenoble where the gates were broken down and the crowds enthusiastically welcomed him. The writer Stendhal, born in the city, described the reaction of the local people in some detail in his A Life of Napoleon and recounts how, unable to present him with the keys of the city, they tore down the gates to give to him instead. \r\n\r\nThe plaque shown here can still be seen Rue de Bonne and bears Napoleon’s own retrospective reflection on the importance of Grenoble to him in 1815: ‘before Grenoble I was a soldier of fortune, at Grenoble I was a Prince again’.",

The cries of ‘Long live the Emperor’ which in 1814 had been seen as seditious became a rallying cry once more in March 1815.\r\n\r\n From as early as July 1814, rumours of the return of Napoleon, carried by the Turks to the gates of Paris, spread even to rural areas of the Massif Central in mountainous central France. The rumours encouraged children to let off firecrackers and some of their parents to declare their support in graffiti on the walls of the villages, much to the consternation of the local monarchist authorities. \r\n\r\nThe Flight of the Eagle in 1815 seemed to realise the hopes of Napoleon’s most fervent supporters. People felt free to express their loyalties once more, this time out in the open. After Napoleon had landed at Golfe-Juan but before he had even reached Paris, some of his supporters went as far as warning others not to harm him.  This can be seen through today’s object from an anonymous villager of the Aveyron region: a placard which was put up in the main square in the town of Laguiole in mid-March 1815. The message is clear: ‘Long live Napoleon, Emperor of the French. Woe betide anyone who lays a finger on him!’\r\n\r\nTo read the original French entry for today, click on the Further information button below.",

Les cris, hier séditieux, de Vive l’empereur, redeviennent mots de ralliement en mars 1815. <br /><br />Dès le mois de juillet 1814, la rumeur du retour de Napoléon porté par les Turcs aux portes de Paris enfle jusque dans les campagnes du Massif Central, encourageant les enfants à sortir les pétards et certains de leurs parents à afficher leur soutien sur les murs des villages ; au plus grand dam des autorités locales monarchistes. <br /><br />Le Vol de l’Aigle concrétise les espoirs des plus dévoués. La parole se libère et les fidélités, un temps contenues, s’affirment au grand jour. Après le débarquement à Golfe Juan, et avant même que l’empereur n’ait rejoint Paris, quelques-uns vont jusqu’à mettre en garde contre toute atteinte à sa personne, à l’instar de cet Aveyronnais anonyme dont le placard affiché au carrefour de la place publique de Laguiole à la mi-mars 1815 est sans équivoque : « Malheur à celui qui y touchera ! ».",

Echoing the cries of ‘down with the priests’ that greeted his arrival in Lyon on 10 March, he entered Autun five days later promising ‘to save the French from the slavery and misery in which the priests and nobles wished to plunge them… I will string them up from the lampposts’ and scolded the clergy for meddling in politics in Auxerre two days later. \r\n\r\nIn reality, this rhetoric was largely posturing and it ceased as soon as Napoleon reached Paris but by then, anticlerical demonstrations, songs and prints were widespread, particularly among the radical fédéré movement that sprang up following the Emperor’s return. \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the Catholic clergy responded to this revival of neo-Jacobin sentiment in kind. While a handful of bishops, like Bausset in Vannes, anathemised Napoleon openly that March, most of their confrères responded more cautiously to the Empire’s resurrection although tellingly, few bishops attended the régime’s re-consecration on the Champ de Mai. By contrast, the parish clergy was far less reserved in its response to Napoleon’s return. From refusing to offer prayers for the Emperor or discouraging recruitment to openly leading their congregations in royalist resistance, priests were, as prefects reported from across France that spring, ‘the royalist party’s most zealous agents’. \r\n\r\nFor many Catholics, the Hundred Days had revived the spectre of religious terror and after Waterloo, they set about exacting a conspicuously sectarian revenge.\r\n",

This is what happened so elegantly to the Mayor of Lyon - the Comte de Fargues - while Napoleon was approaching the city on the 10th March. The Count's first declaration to his population firmly advises the Lyonnais to stay at home and to trust the Mayor's devotion to the city's safety and to the Monarchy. Despite this, the population acclaimed Bonaparte as he was entering the city on the same day. \r\n\r\nThe next morning, Fargues published a second declaration in which he celebrates Napoleon’s victories as well as his ‘charitable and protecting laws’. Rumour has it that the citizens, who were asked to display the declarations on top of the old ones, actually glued the posters side by side, therefore highlighting the Mayor’s hypocrisy. The Count was replaced on the 30th April but he was reappointed as Mayor in July 1815.\r\n",

On the same day, for example, the Morning Post included a poem referring to Napoleon’s downfall –  ‘Like proud napoleon – from the throne rais’d on high,/ Swift toppled down- neglected thou shalt lie’ – while also publishing a translation of Louis XVIII’s ordinance declaring that ‘Napoleon Bonaparte is declared a Traitor and a Rebel, for having introduced himself by force of arms, into the Department of the Var’. \r\n\r\nOnce the news was out, however, some were quick to react: The Examiner for Sunday 12 March 1815 noted that ‘The first notice of this most memorable event was announced by Mr. Rosschild, the Exchange Broker, who sold stock to the amount of 600,000l on the receipt of the news by express from France.’\r\n",

It is likely that she kept keys in it, but the contents could have included miniature portraits of her husband and two sons, whom she doted on.  \r\n\r\nAs the wife of the British Ambassador, she dutifully stayed on in Paris after Wellington left for the Congress of Vienna.  News of Napoleon landing on French soil reached Paris on March 5th, though the French Government kept it secret until the 7th, when the King of France proclaimed him a ‘Traitor’. When Kitty heard of Bonaparte’s escape from Elba, though she may have privately voiced some concern, she doubtless publicly put on a brave face, not wishing to let her husband down. \r\n\r\n However panic did spread amongst the English community, with reports in the press of ‘confusion and terror on every English countenance’ and distressed crowds of English in Calais, desperate to get a passage over the Channel. Every boat in Dover took part in the evacuation. \r\n\r\nEventually Kitty left Paris at 6 o’clock on the evening of Friday, March 10th.  Such were the rumours swirling around, that it was falsely reported that she carried the French Crown jewels with her. \r\n\r\nFor more on Wellington's marriage, click on further information below.\r\n\r\n\r\n [editors' note: to find out who did smuggle the French Crown Jewels out of France, see the entry for 18 March.]",

                "text": "WELLINGTON’S MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nWellington’s marriage is always described as disastrous, but I would pose the question: for whom was it a disaster?  His bad relationship with Kitty enabled Arthur to focus single-mindedly on his career, particularly during the Peninsular War, when he was away for five long years and rarely thought of home.  The marriage was certainly a disaster for Kitty, who yearned for the contentment of a successful union. \r\n\r\nOn a personal level their story is a sad one, for they had a romantic courtship when they were both in their early twenties, and Arthur plucked up the courage to ask for Kitty’s hand. However, the Pakenhams saw no reason to throw away the pretty sought-after Kitty on a penniless young officer, who seemed to have few prospects, and twice they turned down Wellesley’s marriage proposal. Arthur went off to India in 1796 with a heavy heart, but a determination to make something of his life.\r\n\r\nThe couple were forbidden to write to each other, but sometime in 1801 a letter reached Arthur from a mutual friend of his and Kitty’s, a matchmaking Mrs Sparrow, who was intent on rekindling the romance between her friends. Though none of the letters were directly from Kitty, there followed four years of tormented correspondence, and by the time Arthur set foot back on English soil he had decided to try again. This time the Pakenhams were susceptible to his proposal, and why would they not be. He had returned home as a Major-General, been honoured with a knighthood by George III, and now Wellesley’s purse was full of the rewards of his military success. \r\n\r\nRashly, Arthur decided it was not necessary to go over to Dublin to see his intended, despite her begging him to do so: he was more intent on furthering his career. So the first sight Arthur had of Kitty for over ten years was at their Dublin wedding in April 1806. It is said that he was shocked by her appearance. Certainly she was not the young girl he had lost his youthful heart to.  Furthermore, the change in Arthur’s situation and circumstances was dramatic, whereas Kitty’s world was very much as it had been when last he saw her.\r\n\r\nScarcely had their vows been solemnised, than Arthur was back in England, champing at the bit to be off to the battlefield – for if Kitty had a real rival it was the army.  Remarkably, given that at the time of the wedding she was already thirty-four, (Arthur was thirty-six), she produced within the first two years of their union two boys – the heir ‘little Arthur’, and the crucial spare ‘Charlie’.\r\n\r\n The boys would be her great solace in life.  But even before the start of the war, the marriage had suffered its first fracture, brought on by Arthur’s intolerance of Kitty’s inability to manage her finances, and the growing realisation that he had married the wrong woman.\r\n\r\nDuring the Peninsular War, Kitty suffered more than many other wives in the same situation, for Arthur rarely wrote to her about anything other than practical requests for her to send out supplies like tea, or warm blankets, or a particular book he might want.  She was often the last to know about his triumphs or tribulations, and the effect was to turn her further away from the adult world and back to her children.  Unquestionably she suffered from depression, and dark introspective thoughts, that even lead to her contemplating suicide.   She wrote diaries for a lot of the time that her husband was away, and for me the most poignant entry is ‘Alone and Sad’.\r\n \r\nWhen the war was over, and Wellington became British Ambassador in Paris, Kitty was overjoyed to be asked whether she wished to accompany him.  She wrote back to her husband - ‘To an Ambassador’s wife there are no difficulties which I do not feel myself equal to overcome, no duties which I am not willing to perform and may I venture to add that you shall never have reason to regret having allowed me, on this subject, to decide for myself’.  The fact that she stayed on in Paris after Wellington left for the Congress of Vienna is testament to her commitment to her role.\r\n\r\nHowever, any optimism Kitty may have had for the future was short-lived.  After Waterloo the nation claimed their hero, and Wellington’s fame ensured that he would never be able to retire into a private life; nor did he want to.  The military man gave way to the statesman, culminating with a term of office as Prime Minister.  Many considered that Kitty was not a suitable consort for the duke. Wellington likely shared this view, and found his wife’s adoration of him deeply irritating.  \r\n\r\nSeparation was the pattern of their union: their rooms in both their country and London homes were far away from each other, and Kitty rarely featured in his rounds of engagements, whether private or public.\r\n\r\nNot long after Wellington was thrown out of office for his opposition to Parliamentary reform, Kitty became seriously ill, and for the first time in their twenty-five-year marriage, Wellington became the devoted husband.  I suspect this was more to do with conscience than affection, but whatever the motive, it meant that Kitty died, in April 1831, with her hand held by the man she claimed to have loved since she was fifteen.\r\n\r\nAfter Kitty’s death, Wellington could easily have married again - he was certainly not short of admirers.  But it suited him to be independent, and during the rest of his life he formed a number of close and confiding friendships with women.  If the Pakenhams had not turned down the young Arthur Wellesley’s proposal, maybe he and Kitty would have had a marriage based on mutual respect and friendship, as they developed together.   But then the course of history might have been very different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Wellington: A Journey Through My Family' by Jane Wellesley is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson.\r\n",

                "text": "Upon leaving Lyon for Paris on the 13th of March, Napoleon used once again a printed declaration as a way to thank the population for their support. He had already done so in the Hautes-Alpes and in Grenoble. This time, by emphasising how special the relationship between himself and Lyon was, he used a phrase that has remained famous in the history of the city: ‘Lyonnais, je vous aime’ (people of Lyon, I love you). Lyon had - and has - been a city that values a certain institutional equilibrium. Fiercely opposed to the Terror during the Revolution, the Lyonnais had found in Bonaparte the promise of more equality but also stability. \r\n\r\nNapoleon visited Lyon in 1799, 1800, 1802 (from where he founded the Republic of Italy), and in 1805, when he told the local prefect ‘My real throne is in the Lyonnais' hearts’. His plans for a Grand Palais Impérial in the centre of the city never became real but inspired later buildings throughout the nineteenth century, such as Perrache train station.",

While this portrait of a portly Napoleon bearing the stunted standard of his Imperial pretentions exemplifies Lacroix’s acerbic vision of the Hundred Days, its principal target is Marshal Ney, Peer of France and Prince de la Moskowa, depicted here swearing allegiance to the Emperor with his nose buried abjectly in the ample Imperial backside. \r\n\r\nThe first, and one of the few, of Napoleon’s marshals to abandon the Bourbon cause for the Empire that March, Michel Ney’s defection to Napoleon at Lons-le-Saunier on 14 March was undoubtedly the most damaging. With a career stretching back to the battle of Valmy in 1792 and reputedly ‘the last Frenchman on Russian soil’ during the retreat of 1812, Ney was the most popular and the most prestigious of Napoleon’s marshals and, it was thought, the only one who could lead the troops against their former Emperor. Ney’s defection was all the more damaging as he was widely reported to have promised Louis that he would ‘bring the usurper back in an iron cage’ on leaving Paris on 7 March. His reconciliation with the Emperor a week later was accordingly a body blow to the monarchy’s hopes of retaining control of the army and with it, France, and the king abandoned Paris just two days after Ney’s ‘treason’ became known in the capital. \r\n\r\nAt Waterloo, he lived up to his reputation as ‘the bravest of the brave’. With five horses killed under him, he fought to the last and he was never forgiven for it. Arrested on 3 August, he was tried for high treason in the Chamber of Peers and executed by firing squad on 7 December 1815.\r\n",

                "text": "Unlike his brother Louis XVI in 1791, Louis XVIII did not attempt to sneak out of Paris silently. However, as Napoleon advanced on Paris, there was one item which Louis did desire to transport without the knowledge of others, namely the Crown Jewels, a collection of mounted and loose precious stones, diamonds, and pearls including the famous diamond Le Régent (seen here) which was valued at 6 million francs alone. \r\n\r\nThe man nominated for this mission was Baron Hüe. The King charged his faithful courtier with the task of transporting his precious cargo to Calais and then on to England. \r\n\r\nHüe recounts the episode in his memoires: the plan was to leave with the jewels disguised in artillery boxes at midnight on 20th March, but there was so much army movement that he could not escape from the Tuileries Palace until 6am the following morning. News spread fast and Hüe encountered many men along his route who had heard of his secret mission and his precious cargo, most offering help and support.\r\n\r\n In Calais he realised that the political situation was changing too quickly to make it across the Channel so he continued on to Lille where, with all the necessary travel documents, he was able to pass the border despite the presence of some English troops. He headed to Tournai and then Ostende before following the King to Ghent. \r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon’s imperial ministers investigated the disappearance of the Crown Jewels on 28th March 1815 they found an order from Louis XVIII arranging the removal of the Jewels dated as early as 13th March along with Hüe’s signature stating that he had taken everything in two instalments, one on 15th March, the other on 19th March.\r\n",

The scene symbolises both the importance and the fragility of constitutionalism in nineteenth-century France. \r\n\r\nThe Charte, composed in May 1814 and proclaimed 'by the free exercise of our royal authority' on 4 June, retained massive powers for the monarchy. But it also guaranteed equality before the law; religious toleration; a bicameral legislature with control over taxation; freedom of the press; and the inviolability of all past sales of 'biens nationaux': in other words of the revolutionary property settlement. \r\n\r\nOn 16 March 1815, Louis XVIII called it 'our sacred standard' and 'my finest title in the eyes of posterity', denouncing 'he who comes to reignite among us the fires of civil war, [who] also brings the scourge of foreign war' and offering to die in the defence of the French people. \r\n\r\nAll present, including his younger brother and heir the Comte d' Artois, who had absented himself on 4 June, swore loyalty to the Charte. Cheers of 'Vive le roi!’, ‘Mourir pour le roi!' resounded through the chamber. In reality Artois had reservations about the Charte, while the troops outside were preparing to join Napoleon I. Four days later, in the early morning of 20 March, the King who had sworn to remain in Paris fled north towards the Belgian frontier and spent the 100 Days in Ghent.\r\n\r\nFor more about the reverse of the lid and the Charte, click on Further Information.\r\n",

One can also see a soldier showing his son the column in the Place Vendôme (from which the statue of Napoleon I had been removed in 1814), accompanied by a famous line from a popular song of 1818 by Émile Debraux: 'Ah! Qu'on est fier d'être français, quand on regarde la colonne'. The implication is that the liberals of 1820, rather than the King and his supporters in 1815, are the true defenders of the Charte. This box is a reminder that the Hundred Days was not only a dynastic contest between Louis XVIII and Napoleon I, and a military conflict between France and Europe, but also a political dispute over the French constitution. \r\n\r\nThe Charte under Louis XVIII continued to function better than most French constitutions. Three times, in September 1815, February 1820 and December 1821, the King dismissed a ministry or minister who no longer commanded a majority in the Chamber of Deputies in favour of one who did. The Charte guaranteed the monarchy's future. Six years after Artois ascended the throne as Charles X in 1824, his attempt to violate the Charte led to the revolution of July 1830, conducted to cries of ‘Vive la Charte!’ and the proclamation of their cousin the Duc d'Orleans as Louis Philippe I. An amended version of the Charte served as the French constitution until the revolution of 1848. \r\n\r\nOutlasting all Napoleonic constitutions, the Charte would be the principal basis of other constitutions in Europe, from Portugal to the Ottoman Empire. It has also influenced later French constitutions, including that of the Fifth Republic. \r\n\r\nPhilip Mansel is author of \"The Eagle in Splendour: Napoleon I and his Court\", London, George Philip, 25 June 1987, 232 pages, ISBN 0540011215",

                "text": "The 'Journal des Débats', a Parisian literary and political journal, displays two conflicting ideological positions in the run up to, and immediate aftermath of, Napoleon’s Hundred Days. Its abiding aim during the first Restoration of 1814 was to safeguard social and political order, and consolidate Louis XVIII’s reign. The Journal disavowed notions of popular sovereignty and citizenship, and stressed the paternal wisdom and grace of Louis XVIII over his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe news of Napoleon’s escape from Elba, reported in the Journal of 8 March, threatened this political settlement. Initial reports cast him as a foreigner to the French nation, stressing the Italian spelling of his name, and his links to Poles, Neapolitans, and Piedmontese. These reports rapidly gave way to a portrayal of Bonaparte as foreign to the human race in general. He is variously described as an Attila, Genghis Khan, Nero (as in this edition of the Journal from 17 March), ‘a maniac who has fallen through rage into imbecility’, –  and a cannibal. \r\n\r\nHowever, Napoleon’s supporters quickly took over the journal, and on 21 March, it was (again) retitled the 'Journal de l’Empire', its name from 1805 until 1814; the vilification of Napoleon ceased, and there was an immediate emphasis on citizenship, popular sovereignty and nation. But this shift too was reversed after Bonaparte’s defeat and the second restoration of the Bourbon monarchy; by 8 July 1815, the Journal des Débats was once again casting Napoleon as an enemy of the human race. The dehumanizing vocabulary of the journal would serve as a legitimising foundation for the Second White Terror, the backlash against Bonapartists across France in 1815 that ranged from the dismissal of government officials to mob lynchings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The King’s advisors had been divided as to whether he should stay in Paris or go into exile. The fact that he had arranged for the removal of the Crown Jewels as early as 13th March (see the entry for 15th March) shows that while he was publicly declaring his intention to stay put, he was nevertheless preparing for the alternative. By 19th March 1815, he had made up his mind.\r\n\r\n Napoleon meanwhile had reached Auxerre on 18th March, and slept at Pont-sur-Yonne, within striking distance of Paris, on 19th March. The people of France had seemed overwhelming pleased to learn of his advance. The royal volunteers, on the other hand, had seemed ill-equipped to protect the King and the defection of Ney to Napoleon's cause, which the King learned about on 18th March, confirmed the Monarch's decision to leave the Tuileries palace. \r\n",

                "text": "Ironically entitled ‘Französiche Treue’ (‘French loyalty’), Johann Michael Volz’s ink-drawn cartoon comprises two halves showing Paris on consecutive days marking the start of the ‘Hundred Days’. \r\n\r\nOn 19 March French soldiers swear unswerving allegiance to King Louis XVIII, intending to defend him and his throne to their “last drop of blood”. On the very next day they bow before Napoleon, cheering him as he enters Paris on horseback and calling “away with Bourbons!” \r\n\r\nThis shift in army loyalties was a pivotal moment in Napoleon’s return to power. With its somewhat simplified, sequential account, Volz's cartoon reflects ethnic stereotypes of the French as duplicitous and fickle. These stereotypes are also visible in a range of autobiographical texts by German writers as eminent as Friedrich Schlegel and Heinrich von Kleist. \r\n\r\nProduced in Leipzig, a centre of German printing and publishing, Volz’s satire may well have resonated with bitter memories of the (then recent) Battle of Leipzig (1813). Napoleon had lost that battle, but it had left up to 110,000 dead, had seen the French occupation of German towns, had been hugely destructive and costly, and had served to amplify anti-French sentiments and galvanize feelings of burgeoning German nationalism, not least in and around Leipzig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "'Violettes du 20 Mars 1815'\r\nThis small and unassuming print – a hand-coloured etching – is perhaps one of the most laconic yet enigmatic objects to mark Napoleon’s return to Paris and the start of the 100 Days. Referring to the precise date of that event, 20 March 1815, in its title, it ostensibly depicts a bouquet of violets, a flower associated with Napoleon at this time: The origin of this association is unclear but popular myth quotes him as saying upon his defeat in 1814 that, just like the violets in the Fontainebleau palace gardens, he would return within a year, and he was said to have became known as Père Violette amongst his soldiers.\r\n\r\nEchoing his emergence from exile, the negative space between the flowers and foliage appears to materialize into the silhouettes of Napoleon, his wife Marie-Louise and their son (here an English-speaking collector has written a key identifying them), while a leaf deftly morphs into the familiar form of Napoleon’s bicorn hat. \r\n\r\nThis print, the work of Jean Dominique Étienne Canu, belonged to a genre of ‘hidden silhouette’ imagery well established by 1815, and the portraits hidden in plain sight within the image were no secret to a French public well versed in how to ‘decipher’ such prints. Rather, this print offered a witty visualization of the political vicissitudes of the 100 Days. The training in and out of focus between the positive and negative planes of the image stages optically the emerging and submerging of dynasties that bookended the 100 Days, at once anchoring the image’s message and destabilizing it.\r\n\r\nSee also the use of violets in the print ‘Le Printemps ou le retour de la Violette’, our object for 3rd March.\r\n",

Like much anti-Napoleon material, the Corsican usurper’s name is spelt in its original form with the inclusion of the ‘u’, a technique which helped to distance Napoleon from the French, emphasising his illegitimacy. The text goes on to mention the Polish, Neapolitan and Piedmontese banditti who made up Napoleon’s latest army, reinforcing Bonaparte’s dubious non-French ‘Otherness’. \r\n\r\nBut by contrast, Cruikshank’s illustration to this broadside is disarmingly jovial; its forecast of apocalyptic war is quaintly hyperbolic. Alluding to Napoleon’s continued popularity (which was crucial for those arguing in favour of Bonaparte’s legitimacy as a ruler), Cruikshank’s print also takes delight in Bonaparte’s interruption of the restoration of traditional monarchy in Europe. This print exemplifies many of the mixed emotions felt by the British public towards the return of ‘the extraordinary Buonaparte’.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "<strong>1) Napoleon Bonaparte in British Caricature</strong> <br /><br />For all the mockery that the infamous Corsican bugaboo attracted, British print-makers and consumers were obsessed with Napoleon throughout his reign and beyond, with certain prints betraying an admiration for him, sometimes begrudgingly so, or even stronger emotions such as sympathy. <br /><br />Thomas Rowlandson, William Heath, George Cruikshank and James Gillray all produced prints which charted Napoleon’s extraordinary journey from his relatively humble beginnings to becoming the dominant personality in Europe. Though they were often critical and unflattering caricatures, such prints provided an entertaining and accessible history of the man. Most other caricature victims appeared exclusively in single-sheet satires focusing on the particular issue of the moment, rather than stage-by-stage summaries of how the individual arrived at his or her present position. <br /><br />Napoleon’s presence as this proto-comic strip hero/anti-hero discloses some of the awe felt towards the undeniably talented general who had achieved his power and status through personal merit rather than effortless inheritance. <br /><br />Images: <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=184888&amp;objectId=1655329&amp;partId=1\">The Progress of the Emperor Napoleon</a> [Thomas Rowlandson. 19 November 1808] <br /> <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=142955&amp;objectId=1636601&amp;partId=1\">Democracy; - or - a Sketch of the Life of Buonaparte </a>[James Gillray. 12 May 1800]  <br /><br /><strong>2) Gillray &amp; Gulliver</strong> <br /><br />More mischievous were those prints, pioneered by James Gillray and imitated by others, that cast Napoleon - not as a diminutive Lilliputian, as is sometimes mistaken - but as Jonathan Swift’s hero Lemuel Gulliver visiting the land of Brobdingnag. Here Napoleon became a rather plucky underdog subjected to the torment of the ogre-like British royals. As James Baker has argued, in these Swiftian designs the royals and their circle ‘are not representative of the majority looking down upon Napoleon, rather Napoleon-cum-Gulliver represents the majority looking up to them’, while the prints double as a critique of the elite’s ostensible need for playthings and fripperies, particularly in wartime.<br /> Images: <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=147044&amp;objectId=1638544&amp;partId=1%20\">The King of Brobdingnag, and Gulliver</a> [James Gillray. 26 June 1803] <br /><p> <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=150091&amp;objectId=1662541&amp;partId=1\">The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.</a> <em>(Plate 2d.)</em> [James Gillray. 10 February 1804]<br /><br /></p>\n<strong>3) Elba</strong> <br /><br />Subsequently, prints depicting Bonaparte’s banishment to Elba in 1814 did so with a mixture of humour and pathos, imagining the ‘great man’ reduced to sitting, weeping on a tiny rock, greeted by gross locals, striving to rally an army out of this imbecilic population, or desperately and insanely playing toy soldiers with straw. It was probably The Sorrows of Boney or a print very much like it that John Scott (1783-1821) described as having ‘a very touching character’, due to the ‘great disproportion between the size of the place and of its inhabitant’. <br /><br />Napoleon’s dramatic return from Elba added yet another barely-believable, legend-like element to his incredible story, stimulating many prints noticeable for their electricity. A prolific etcher of these was George Cruikshank who depicted Bonaparte rising from flames like a phoenix, unceremoniously booting Louis XVIII from his throne, and on more than one occasion bursting through a door or window to interrupt the burlesqued rulers of Europe in the act of dividing territory in his absence. <br /><br />Images: <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=76812&amp;objectId=1480760&amp;partId=1\">The sorrows of Boney, or meditations in the island of Elba!!!</a> [15 April 1814]  <br /><a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=171178&amp;objectId=1646014&amp;partId=1%20\">Boneys return from Elba-or the devil among the tailors</a> [George Cruikshank. 21 March 1815] <br /><br /><strong>4) George Cruikshank</strong> <br /><br />George Cruikshank’s Elba prints contain a palpable aura of excitement at the return of ‘Boney’. Part of this might have been financial thrill; the caricaturist’s relief at the return of the person whose image had sold so consistently well in recent years. It is possible that Cruikshank’s conscious or subconscious mind may also have been tapping into the emotions he had personally experienced when his brother Robert went missing at sea in 1804 and was declared dead, only to arrive home safely two years later, much to the surprise of his mourning family. <br />Sometimes aided by the Devil but evoking the phoenix, Prometheus, Orpheus, Lazarus and even Christ, Napoleon flickers between the role of hero and villain in such pieces. The disturbance of the European monarchs, whose self-satisfied laurel-resting has been disturbed to their shocked and horrified amazement by their adversary’s sudden return, has been etched with an infectious glee. <br />Even in the prints which use Cruikshank’s caricatures as accompaniments to anti-Napoleon verses, the artist emphasises the dubiousness of the restored Louis XVIII and other participants in the Congress of Vienna, as well as the continuing (or renewed) popularity of Bonaparte in the eyes of the French. <br />In John Bull in Alarm the verses describe Bonaparte as a satanic ‘thief’ who should be caught and skinned like an eel, yet Cruikshank’s picture shows the obese Louis XVIII, grasping a pouch of ‘Jewels, Precious Stones, &amp;c &amp;c’, kicked by Napoleon from his throne towards representatives of ‘England’, ‘Russia’, and ‘Prussia’. On the left, joyous Frenchmen cheer their hero, whereas on the right, John Bull consoles the Bourbon, ‘Cheer up old Lewis for as fast as he kicks you down we’ll pop you up again.’ Given the unflattering caricature of Louis, this statement reads more ominous than triumphant, channelling the unease that was felt by many in Britain towards the prospect of Bourbon restoration. <br />Image: <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=172897&amp;objectId=1646221&amp;partId=1%20\">John Bull in alarm; or, Boney's escape, and a second deliverance of Europe</a> [George Cruikshank. c. April 1815] <br /><br /><strong>5) Escape of Buonaparte From Elba</strong> <br /><br />In the bottom left of his picture, Cruikshank has included a mass of celebrating Frenchmen, signifying Napoleon’s continued popularity. This popularity was a crucial factor in British debates over the Emperor’s legitimacy. Supporters of Napoleon could cite his popularity, while perhaps also alluding to the relative unpopularity and arguable illegitimacy of British rulers, particularly the Prince Regent. As Stuart Semmel has shown, arguments over Napoleon’s contested legitimacy often reflected very badly on Britain’s own leadership. Since the Glorious Revolution and Hanoverian Succession, the British monarch owed its position to parliamentary support which some saw as virtually akin to the popular election of a monarch. And the Hanoverians owed their crown to an illicit landing of troops, much like Bonaparte’s surprise return. These episodes, argued radicals, undermined the British Regent’s claims to fight on the behalf of ‘hereditary legitimacy’. By defending the hereditary Louis XVIII against the more popular Napoleon, the Regent ‘would chip away at the very principle that had installed his own family on Britain’s throne’. For men such as William Hazlitt and William Hone (the latter was friends and collaborated with Cruikshank), Napoleon was adopted as a symbol of liberty against the ancien régimes of Europe. <br /><br />Setting the tone of Cruikshank’s illustration from its centre flies that grinning demon figure who looks disarmingly jolly and amiable as he transports Napoleon back to Europe. The picture features skulls, skeletons and allusions to apocalyptic war, all very threatening symbols, but to whom? They are flying towards that group of complacent European monarchs on the left, asleep at their table during their congress. Are they about to get their comeuppance? Back in Elba, meanwhile, stand empty gallows and three small figures registering astonishment at the absence of their intended victim. This scene recalls accounts of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century criminals who, usually through the failure of the hangman or his equipment, managed to momentarily escape their execution, and in doing so won over the support of the assembled crowd, irrespective of his or her crime. With Cruikshank tapping into cultural traits such as this, and given Napoleon’s caricatural history, the sight of Bonaparte’s miraculous escape from his own supposedly conclusive fate was likely to have provoked cheers as well as jeers from London’s printshop window crowds. <br />Image <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=947447&amp;objectId=1645983&amp;partId=1\">close-up</a>",

In March 1815, rumours were flying around, even in the countryside. \r\n\r\nWith Tom away, Mary wrote on 20 March to tell him that Joanna had ridden to nearby Presteigne ‘in hopes of finding a newspaper to satisfy us on the report we have had of B. having entered Paris’. It was terrible not to have a paper, ‘at such a time as this when we are all anxiety both on this subject and the Corn laws –we have not had one since the 13th and therefore are in utter darkness, probably made more gloomy by reports which are afloat in the neighbourhood . . . What can these wise Emperors & Kings think of themselves now, for giving such a tyranny an opportunity of once more bringing misery upon the world when they had it in them to destroy him?’\r\n\r\nIn contrast to her own anxiety, Mary observed that most farmers seemed to be pleased, having feared a drastic lowering of corn prices when peace came. More than half of them, who ‘think of themselves alone and look no further than the present, would be most happy to have war again’.  \r\n\r\nMary’s letter gives us an insight into the uneven circulation of news around Britain in this period, and the constant struggle to separate fact from fiction; at the same time, her comments on the farmers’ satisfaction at the resumption of war hints at the variety of ways that Napoleon’s return affected everyday life in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

John Fairburn, 2, Broadway, Ludgate-Hill, London\r\n\r\nTune: unknown\r\n\r\nIn Fairburn’s broadside-cum-caricature, the great diplomats assembled at the Congress of Vienna hammer cracks in the iron pot of Europe; Napoleon emerges from a hole in the bottom. This scatological note is no reflection on the mischievous Corsican, however, who is depicted – by contemporary British standards – as young, slim, and vigorous, brandishing a sabre.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics below are in the style of society journalism, rather than popular balladry, with polite redactions of names such as Castlereagh that of course leave them wholly legible. This is high traditional Grub Street satire, lambasting the greed of Europe’s powers, and it comes with a troubling moral. Napoleon, formerly a byword in similar London productions for annexatory excess, appears as the Congress’ punishment; it is their tinkering, not his ambition, that causes his return.\r\n\r\n A hasty final verse implying that the British Lion (as opposed to Britain’s statesmen) will save the day, is far from reassuring – despite its defiant final couplet.\r\n\r\nThough the subject and form is that of high politics, the imagery – clumsy tinkers, a kettle, a mischievous faerie – is pure folklore. This is Napoleon as trickster, an appealing anti-heroic sprite. If the morality tale is clear, the print’s politics are more nebulous.\r\n\r\nFor a transcription of the song lyrics, click on further information.\r\n",

                "text": "This hand-coloured print also belongs to the collection at Eton College. It was made in Germany soon after Napoleon’s defeat in 1815. At the foot of the print the caption declares: \r\n\r\n‘Bonaparte landed on the 1st March 1815 at Cannes in France to wave the torch of war once more around the globe. Through revolutionary proclamations, he led a part of the army to break their oath of loyalty to their rightful king and drove fear into the peaceful citizens who knew their duty, but the firm will and the united might of Europe rose quickly against him and cast the ruin that he’d intended to wreak on other lands over him and his followers.’\r\n\r\nNapoleon is shown setting fire to the house of a peasant family who turn back to watch, a look of horror on their faces: the obvious terror of their child seems especially poignant. Napoleon’s men have already looted the home: the Germans had suffered greatly at the hands of French troops in the ‘peacetime’ of occupation as well as in wartime. Napoleon himself is shown standing on France (labelled Frankreich) to emphasize that he had escaped Elba and returned to the epicentre of his earlier crimes. In the background, the boat and the water are both a reminder of his escape and a suggestion that no sooner had he landed, than the looting and burning began. Napoleon faces inland, along with another soldier who points in the same direction, presumably towards Paris. This is the threat that hung over the whole of France, or so the print-maker seems to be saying. In contempt of Napoleon’s boast that he retook France without any bloodshed, the print-maker retrospectively illustrates the danger that Napoleon’s return represented for the people of Europe.\r\n",

                "text": "With news of Napoleon's return from Elba having reached Vienna, on 25th March 1815 the allies reaffirmed the treaty of Chaumont (a pact signed by Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia on 1 March 1814) by which they had promised to support each other if any one of them was threatened by the 'enemy' once again troubling the peace of Europe. Talleyrand, Louis XVIII's representative in Vienna, did not take part in the negotiations but was presented with a copy for the King of France to endorse. At this stage, they all thought Louis still in Paris... <br /><br />In an era full of captivating personalities, the French statesman Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754-1838) surely counts among the most intriguing. Having served as a diplomat under successive French regimes from the Revolution to the July Monarchy, his name has become a byword for political acumen and cunning, but also for opportunism and betrayal. The cartoon shown here, which was first published anonymously in 1815, depicts Talleyrand with six different heads, each of which pledges allegiance to a different regime, including the Monarchy, the Empire, and the Restoration. In the one hand he holds a bishop’s crosier, and in the other, a weather vane, symbolic of his remarkable ability to predict (and then adapt) to shifts within the political climate.<br /><br />As well as a born survivor, Talleyrand was also a prodigious diplomat, and served as France’s chief representative during the Congress of Vienna. There, he was able to engineer a relatively lenient settlement for his country, which was allowed to retain the frontiers of 1792. Under King Louis-Philippe (1830-1848), Talleyrand served as French ambassador to London, where he became the toast of British high society. He died in 1838 and was buried in the Loire Valley.

                "text": "For Charles Dibdin, the savvy manager of Sadler’s Wells Theatre, Britain’s war with Napoleonic France was big box office. Sadler’s Wells was one of London’s many 'illegitimate' theatres in that it did not possess a licence to perform spoken-word drama: on Monday 27th March 1815, the season opened with a 'naumachia' (a staging of a sea battle) that capitalized on renewed public interest in the war in the wake of Napoleon’s return.<br /><br /><em>The Battle of the Nile</em> offered audiences a re-enactment of Nelson’s victory over the French fleet at Aboukir Bay, Egypt in August 1798. This highly unusual, illustrated playbill for the production depicts its spectacular and patriotic climax, which showed, as an advertisement in the Times reported, 'the blowing up of the L’Orient' (the French flagship) followed by 'a grand transparency of Lord Nelson and other distinguished Admirals'. All this action took place in a water tank installed on the Wells’s stage in 1804, precisely to mount such nautical entertainments. At 90 foot long, 24 foot wide, and 3 feet deep, the tank took around 12 hours to fill (water being diverted from the nearby New River) and its water was changed just once every three weeks. But this didn’t stop spectators routinely leaping into it at the end of a night’s performance!",

                "text": "Lord Byron (1788-1824) had been an ardent admirer of Napoleon since boyhood. Thus upon hearing of the Emperor’s abdication in April 1814, the poet wrote: ‘Out of town six days. On my return, found my poor little pagod, Napoleon, pushed off his pedestal;—the thieves are in Paris. It is his own fault. Like Milo, he would rend the oak; but it closed again, wedged his hands, and now the beasts—lion, bear, down to the dirtiest jackall—may all tear him.’ In his subsequent ‘Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte’ (published 16 April 1814), he regretted his hero's humiliation, and expressed disappointment that the Emperor hadn't killed himself rather than abdicate. (Napoleon did in fact attempt suicide shortly after).<br /><br />The brief reversal of Napoleon’s fortunes in 1815 prompted Byron’s droll letter to the Irish poet Thomas Moore on 27 March 1815 (see Thomas Moore’s own letter to Lady Donegal on 28 March]), in which he declared his forgiveness for Napoleon rendering his ‘Ode’ redundant. His amazement at Napoleon’s good fortune in his journey towards Paris found a poetic outlet in the letter: <br /><br />Once fairly set out on his party of pleasure,<br />Taking towns at his liking and crowns at his leisure,<br />From Elba to Lyons and Paris he goes,<br />Making balls for the ladies, and bows to his foes. <br /><br />Byron’s conclusion leaves no doubt as to his continued admiration: ‘It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by his character and career. Nothing ever so disappointed me as his abdication, and nothing could have reconciled me to him but some such revival as his recent exploit; though no one could anticipate such a complete and brilliant renovation.’<br /><br />For a fuller transcription of the letter, see further information.

                "text": "Lord Byron to Thomas Moore, 27 March 1815<br /><br />Napoleon—but the papers will have told you all. I quite think with you upon the subject, and for my real thoughts this time last year, I would refer you to the last pages of the Journal I gave you. I can forgive the rogue for utterly falsifying every line of mine Ode—which I take to be the last and uttermost stretch of human magnanimity. Do you remember the story of a certain Abbé, who wrote a treatise on the Swedish Constitution, and proved it indissoluble and eternal? Just as he had corrected the last sheet, news came that Gustavus III. had destroyed this immortal government. ‘Sir,’ quoth the Abbé, ‘the King of Sweden may overthrow the constitution, but not my book!!’ I think of the Abbé, but not with him.<br /><br />Making every allowance for talent and most consummate daring, there is, after all, a good deal in luck or destiny. He might have been stopped by our frigates—or wrecked in the Gulf of Lyons, which is particularly tempestuous—or—a thousand things. But he is certainly Fortune’s favourite, and <br /><br />Once fairly set out on his party of pleasure,<br />Taking towns at his liking and crowns at his leisure,<br />From Elba to Lyons and Paris he goes,<br />Making balls for the ladies, and bows to his foes.<br /><br />You must have seen the account of his driving into the middle of the royal army, and the immediate effect of his pretty speeches. And now if he don’t drub the allies, there is ‘no purchase in money’. If he can take France by himself, the devil’s in’t if he don’t repulse the invaders, when backed by those celebrated sworders—those boys of the blade, the Imperial Guard, and the old and new army. It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by his character and career. Nothing ever so disappointed me as his abdication, and nothing could have reconciled me to him but some such revival as his recent exploit; though no one could anticipate such a complete and brilliant renovation.<br /><br />[The manuscript has not been found; the earliest record of the letter is in <em>Letters and Journals of Lord Byron with Notices of his Life</em> by Thomas Moore (London: John Murray, 1830).",

                "text": "Shown here in an early nineteenth-century portrait by an unknown artist, the Irish poet and songwriter Thomas Moore trod a fine line during the Napoleonic Wars: society darling, yet unabashed Bonapartist. Napoleon’s dramatic return in 1815 won round numerous severe critics: Moore needed no such convincing.<br /><br />In a giddy letter to Lady Donegal, on 27 March, 1815, his language epitomises both the Romantic rhetoric and the popular iconography that wreathed the returning emperor. ‘What do you think now of my supernatural friend, the emperor? ... Milton’s Satan is nothing to him for portentous magnificence – for sublimity of mischief! If that account in the papers be true, of his driving down in his carriage like lightning towards the royal army embattled against him, bare-headed, unguarded, in all the confidence of irresistibility – it is a fact far sublimer than any that fiction has ever invented, and I am not at all surprised at the dumb-founded fascination that seizes people at such daring.’<br /><br />Moore dwells on the sublime, the elemental, the heroic – features not only of elite poetic responses, but the vernacular song tradition developing in Ireland and the north of Britain that celebrated Napoleon. There are more pragmatic reasons for a wider revival in British Bonapartism, however. Once in Paris, Napoleon's liberal politics and pacific proclamations helped restore the faith of British radicals. Moreover, for the first time, Napoleon was juxtaposed in close geographic and temporal proximity to the Bourbon alternative, against the backdrop of the Congress of Vienna. Such a staging could not but favour Napoleon in the eyes of most (if not all) observers.",

                "text": "The appointment of a former Jacobin radical revolutionary, Lazare Carnot, as Minister of the interior on 20 March, and Napoleon's abolition of the slave trade on 29 March 1815 were just two of the 'liberal' measures the Emperor undertook during the 100 Days. Not everyone interpreted them favourably, as this Dutch print shows... <br /><br />‘The Jacobins undressing Napoleon’ [De Jacobijnen kleeden Napoleon Uydt] is a Dutch caricature from 1815 by Wijnand Esser (1779-1860), painter, illustrator and engraver, who worked successively in Groningen, La Haye and Amsterdam. Two centuries on, Esser is still remembered because of his impressive series of anti-Napoleonic caricatures, which all date from the Hundred Days. The time was ripe. Inspired by the British who had never stopped ridiculing ‘little Boney’, Spanish, Russian and German caricaturists all tried to outdo each other from 1812-1813 onwards, multiplying their satires against Napoleon; after Waterloo all of Europe joined in.<br /><br />It is rare, however, to find a print that transforms the Emperor of the French into a partisan – or victim – of the Jacobins. In choosing this angle, Esser interprets the Hundred Days as a return to the radical period of the French Revolution, and above all, as a victory for French extremists – especially Lazare Carnot – over Napoleon. Was this prompted by the federates of 1814 and by the appointment of Carnot to the Ministry of the Interior? Possibly, but the image shows above all the trauma experienced during this period by the Dutch, who were forced to become French in 1810, and who consequently felt the irresistible need to belittle the man responsible.

Esser a survécu à l’oubli des siècles en raison de sa série impressionnante de caricatures antinapoléoniennes, qui toutes datent des Cent-Jours. Le temps s’y prêtait. Inspirés des Britanniques qui n’avaient cessé de ridiculiser le petit ‘Boney’, Espagnols, Russes et Allemands ont rivalisé de zèle, à partir de 1812-1813, et multiplié les satires contre Napoléon. Après Waterloo, tous les Européens les ont rejoints. Rares pourtant sont ceux qui ont transformé l’empereur des Français en un partisan – victime – des Jacobins. Par ce biais, Esser interprète les Cent-Jours comme un retour à la période radicale de la Révolution, et surtout, comme une victoire des extrémistes français – de Carnot, en particulier, sur Napoléon. Est-ce dû aux fédérés de 1814 et à la nomination de Carnot au ministère? Cela se pourrait, mais l’image dévoile avant tout le traumatisme éprouvé durant la période par les Néerlandais, contraints en 1810 de devenir français, et l’irrésistible besoin d’en rabaisser le responsable. \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "Cobbett’s <em>Political Register</em>, 1 April 1815<br /><br />William Cobbett argued throughout the Hundred Days that the French people should be allowed to choose their own government and that Britain should not begin another war with Napoleon unprovoked. In this article, styled as an open letter to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh, Cobbett contends that Napoleon's return proved ‘the folly, as well as the injustice, of using foreign force for the purpose of dictating to a great nation who they should have for their rulers, or what shall be the form of their Government ... if he be not now fairly chosen by the people of France, never was man fairly chosen in this world'.<br /><br />This document is remarkable in light of Cobbett’s previous commitment to the war against Napoleon. He opposed the Peace of Amiens in 1802 and on the resumption of hostilities he was commissioned by the government to write a rousing call to arms that was circulated to every parish in England and Wales. Within a few years, however, Cobbett began to question the justification for the war and the way it was being fought and funded. He also expressed qualified praise of Bonaparte and the liberal reforms he introduced, including the Code Napoléon.",

                "text": "William Cobbett began his career in Philadelphia during the 1790s, publishing fiercely anti-Jacobin journalism and pamphlets under the pseudonym ‘Peter Porcupine’. Setting himself up as a staunchly patriotic representative of ‘Old England’ – he was, he wrote, ‘a calf of John Bull’ – he denounced the revolutionaries in France, democrats in France and would-be reformers and revolutionaries in Britain and Ireland.<br /><br />In 1800, Cobbett fled the United States following a libel conviction and was welcomed back to England by the ministry. Although he refused the editorship of a government paper, wishing to preserve his independence, Cobbett initially continued to support the loyalist cause and, above all, the war against Napoleon. In 1801, he opposed the negotiations with France that led to the Peace of Amiens and his house and shop were attacked when he refused to illuminate following the signing of the preliminaries to peace. During this truce, the French ambassador to London conveyed Napoleon’s personal complaints about Cobbett’s attacks (see George Spater, <em>William Cobbett: The Poor Man’s Friend</em>, 2 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), vol. 1, p. 125.)<br /><br />On the renewal of hostilities, Cobbett was commissioned by the government to write a patriotic address, 'Important Considerations for the People of this Kingdom' (1803), which was circulated anonymously to every parish in England and Wales, ‘to be deposited in the pews and … distributed in the aisles, among the poor’ (‘CIRCULAR.—To the Officiating Ministers of the several Parishes in England and Wales’, <em>Political Register</em>, 30 July 1803, 129). In this address, Cobbett warned of the threat of invasion, using lurid descriptions of the depredations of Napoleon’s armies in Germany.<br /><br />At this point, Cobbett was recognised as one of the leading exponents of loyalist rhetoric and might be seen as an embodiment of Linda Colley’s model of a belligerent, anti-French ‘Britishness’, created in the ‘Second Hundred Years’ War’ with France (See Linda Colley, <em>Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707-1837</em> (London: Yale University Press, 1992), passim.). Within a few years, however, Cobbett’s views changed dramatically. As the threat of invasion receded, his focus turned instead to the funding of the war through loans that added millions to the National Debt and led to high inflation and taxation. Revelations about corruption in the army and government convinced him that the war was being fought not in the national interest but in the interests of a corrupt political and financial elite. He began to revise his view of Napoleon, praising him for bringing an end to feudal tyranny in France and abolishing the Inquisition in Spain. He also drew a favourable comparison between Bonaparte’s character and the behaviour of the British ruling class: ‘He is sober … His hours of recreation are not spent at the gaming table, but in the manly exercises of the field.’ (Spater, William Cobbett, vol. 2, p. 334) However, he condemned Napoleon’s personal ambition and believed that France would be better served by a republican government.<br /><br />Following Napoleon’s abdication in 1814, Cobbett hoped for parliamentary reform in Britain, which could no longer be put on hold by war, but opposed the imposition of the Bourbons under Louis XVIII: part of an attempt to restore the old order across Europe. In 1815, Cobbett’s <em>Political Register</em> conveyed the excitement of unfolding events: on 11 March, Cobbett had time to add, as the paper was going to press, ‘BUONAPARTE IN FRANCE!!! (see the entry for 11 March). He wrote: 'This unlooked for and extraordinary occurrence was announced last night to the astonished inhabitants of the metropolis’. The following week he reflected that ‘LOUIS the desired has not done what was promised. He has not abolished the heaviest taxes; he has not left religion as he found it; he has not adhered to the Code of Napoleon; he has not left the press free’. Cobbett addressed the British government: 'I now beseech, I implore them, not, on any account, to draw the sword, to waste the treasure and pour out the blood of our beloved and long suffering country in this new quarrel.—We all now feel the sorrows of a twenty years war, in the taxes and troubles which have trod upon its heels … let who will be the Ruler, LET US HAVE PEACE WITH HIM.'<br /><br />Over the following months, Cobbett argued that the French people must be allowed to choose their own government and Britain should not go to war with Napoleon unless attacked. Having been imprisoned for two years in Newgate following his conviction for seditious libel (1810-12), Cobbett was particularly concerned about press freedom in France and wrote that ‘when I heard of the landing of Napoleon, the first thought that came athwart my mind was, that now those men who had been imprisoned for LIBELS would be restored to freedom, an object worth, of itself, a little revolution’ (1 April). He continued to criticise the war after Waterloo: for example, in a further letter to Lord Castlereagh, published on 29 July, he responded to the celebrations of the loyalist press: 'The Courier says: “The play is over; let us go to supper.” … “The play” may be over; but, oh! no! we cannot “go to supper.” We have something to do. We have forty-five millions a year for ever to pay for the play. This is no pleasant thing. But, indeed, the play is not over. The first act is, perhaps, closed. But, that grand revolution, that bright star, which first burst forth in the year 1789, is still sending forth its light over the world. In that year, feudal and ecclesiastical tyranny, ignorance, superstition, received the first heavy blow: they have since received others; and in spite of all that can be now done in their favour, they are destined to perish.'<br /><br />At one shilling, the <em>Political Register</em> was still prohibitively expensive for many potential readers. However, from November 1816, Cobbett exploited a loophole in the stamp duty laws and started issuing each week’s leading article as a single, unstamped sheet, which could be sold for two pence. His circulation increased by as much as tenfold to 50,000 copies a week and his arguments against corruption and in favour of reform reached a truly popular audience for the first time. Harnessing the mood of post-war discontent, the cheap <em>Register</em> – or ‘Twopenny Trash’, the name Cobbett took up from his opponents – played a vital role in the years of protest and agitation for reform that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars, described by E. P. Thompson as ‘the heroic age of popular Radicalism’ (E. P. Thompson, <em>The Making of the English Working Class</em> (London: Victor Gollancz, 1963), p. 603).",

                "text": "Louis first headed for Lille when he left Paris on 19 March. It was conveniently located - within reach of the Channel ports or the Belgian border should it be necessary to go into exile once more. He reached Lille on 22 March, having been well received in Beauvais and Abbeville en route. But the garrison in Lille was hostile to the royal cause and Louis realised that the town couldn’t become an alternative seat of government. His only option was to leave the country.<br /><br />In a letter to Talleyrand dated 26 March, Louis justified his decision to leave France on the grounds that the troops had all gone over to ‘Buonaparte’, even if he, the King, still had the hearts of the French. Once he had decided to head to Belgium, Louis disbanded the Maison du Roi, his household troops, as he could not afford to maintain them. Only those wealthy enough to support themselves followed the King into exile. He went first to Ostend but then decided to make Ghent his residence in exile. Louis arrived in Ghent on 31 March 1815 and stayed in the house of Jean-Baptiste d'Hane-Steenhuyse (seen here), which is now a museum. At times to the chagrin of the owner and his family, Louis set up his court there for the rest of the 100 Days. The writer Helen Maria Williams writes about how the Royalist supporters in Paris used to sing a song about 'notre père de Gand' (our father in Ghent) which the police had to let pass because the phrase orally sounds the same as 'pair de gants' (pair of gloves), and therefore inoculous.",

                "text": "On 1 April 1815, despite orders from Général Clauzel, the 8th Line Infantry Regiment entered Bordeaux. While Louis XVIII fled towards Ghent, the Duchess of Angoulême had been trying to organize resistance to Napoleon in the city, and had established herself there on 5 March. Bordeaux was fervently royalist and had hailed her husband, the elder son of Louis XVIII’s brother, on the occasion of his formal entry into the city on 12 March 1814.<br /><br />Both Général Clauzel, who led the troops who came to regain control over the city in the name of the Emperor, and Napoleon himself had a wholehearted respect for the Duchess of Angoulême. Based in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, Général Clauzel had ordered his troops to wait until the Duchess of Angoulême had left Bordeaux, but the 8th Line disobeyed and entered the city. The Royalists mistakenly believed that these troops wanted to take part in the defence of Bordeaux alongside the National Guard. Only as she visited the barracks did the Duchess understand that the 8th Line was actually hostile to her. She decided to leave Bordeaux in the evening, when the French tricolour was already flying over Château-Trompette.",

                "text": "Eldest daughter and only surviving child of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, Marie-Thérèse, duchesse d’Angoulême, led a spirited opposition to Napoleon during the 100 Days. She had gone to Bordeaux at the start of March expecting to celebrate the first anniversary of Wellington’s capture of the port, but swung into action as the crisis unfolded. <br /><br />Despite reports that Napoleon’s ally General Clauzel was closing in on Bordeaux, she steadfastly refused to flee and instead tried to rally the troops to the Bourbon cause. After constant pressure, she finally agreed to leave the port on 2nd April, accepting that to stay any longer was to risk the lives of her supporters. She boarded a ship to Spain, eventually travelling to England and joining her uncle Louis XVIII at Ghent.  In recognition of her brave show of defiance, Napoleon dubbed her the 'only man in the family'.<br /><br />This psychologically acute study of Marie-Thérèse by Antoine-Jean Gros preceded completion of the full portrait commissioned by the Chamber of Deputies in 1816. In the same year, Gros was charged with immortalizing the duchess’ departure at Pauillac, Bordeaux, with the heroism and pathos of a grand history painting (see <a href=\"http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;NUMBER=1&amp;GRP=0&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=9&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;DOM=All&amp;REQ=(('Bx+E+61')+%3AINV+)\">here</a>). This more intimate portrait was purchased from the estate of lawyer Pierre-Antoine Berryer by John Bowes, a keen enthusiast for revolutionary and Napoleonic history. It is still in the Bowes Museum in Durham.<br /><br /><br />",

An extract from a letter sent by an anonymous correspondent, and published by the 'Diario Balear' on 31 March, offered a detailed account of Napoleon's landing in the vicinity of Cannes and his plans to travel towards Grenoble; the refusal of the governor of Antibes to provide assistance; and the mobilization of over 6,000 men from Marseilles and Toulouse where loyalty to the Bourbon monarch had been expressed by the procession of a statue of Henry IV, shouts against the 'Tiger and Tyrant' and the dressing of all balconies with white flags. <br /><br />Napoleon was travelling North and not South - a crucial piece of information for readers who had lived under the shadow of a Napoleonic invasion for almost a decade. The Balearic Islands, unlike most of mainland Iberia, had not experienced French occupation, but had suffered considerably due to a flood of immigration caused by Napoleon’s interference in both Spain and Italy. Napoleon's return was therefore the source of great speculation, and the authorities would move to introduce censorship as an attempt to take control of news that had been circulating for several weeks.

                "text": "The woodcut, a mirrored copy of George Cruikshank’s March 1815 print ‘Hell Broke Loose’ (see bottom left of the page for a link to the Cruikshank print), is a Saturnalian riot of fleeing Britons and imposing martial French soldiers; Napoleon himself towers over the scene, leading his men to Paris, symbolised by the Arc de Triomphe and a guillotine. It is an image rich in allusion – yet it is outstripped in this regard by the accompanying song. <br /><br />Superficially, ‘Boney’s Return to Paris’ is a simple comic response to the news, dwelling with glee on the fickleness of fortune and the plight, rendered absurd, of London tourists forced to escape the French capital. But the song has a history: it is a reprisal of another song, ‘The Corsican Drover’, which had discussed an identical circumstance in 1803 after the end of the Peace of Amiens – and itself a parody of James Smith’s 1802 poem ‘All the World’s in Paris’. <br /><br />Smith’s original simply mocked the fashionable tourists; it was the parody that inverted events to reflect the British flight. In 1814, Smith’s original was sung by Grimaldi, a famous clown, in a Christmas pantomime at Covent Garden. The tune – an interpretation of ‘Yankee Doodle Dandy’ – was a witty nod to the ‘macaronis’ satirised in that song of the 1770s, the idea being that the tourists of 1814 were also absurdly overdressed. This is as much a tale of late-Georgian theatre and satire as of Napoleon’s return: the emperor made the news, but he could not escape entanglement in idiosyncratic English allusions.<br /><br />You can hear the Waterloo Singers (including the author of this entry) and their rendition of the song <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/research/french/currentprojects/napoleonictheatre/100daysconcert/\">here</a>.",

                "text": "In this pamphlet, penned in September 1815, counter-revolutionary conspirator Louis Fauche-Borel (1762-1829) railed against those opportunists and hypocrites who had nearly cost Louis XVIII his throne. He narrated the complacency and factionalism he had witnessed during the Hundred Days.\r\n\r\nFollowing the arrival of émigrés in Neuchâtel, his home city, during the Revolution, Fauche-Borel had undertaken two decades of plotting to persuade leading generals and statesmen – including Moreau, Pichegru and Barras – to defect to the Bourbon king(s). These far-flung schemes produced few results, but entailed considerable sacrifices, including three years in the Temple prison and the entrapment and execution of his nephew. Yet even his irreproachable loyalty was questioned in 1815.\r\n\r\nIn March Fauche-Borel rushed to obtain diplomatic assurances from the Allies in Vienna that Louis XVIII could count on their support. It was feared Wellington and Hardenberg preferred a regency for the King of Rome (Napoleon Bonaparte’s son) to foisting the Bourbons back on an unwilling France. But when he arrived in Ghent in April, armed with the news, the comte de Blacas had Fauche-Borel expelled to Brussels and then thrown into prison as a potential spy. \r\n\r\nAlthough later exonerated, the incident reveals the deep suspicions among monarchists caused by years of exile, espionage and pervasive treachery.\r\n\r\nThis copy of the pamphlet was owned by (and features underlining by) the second Earl Grey (1764-1845), a Whig politician and later Prime Minister of Great Britain and Ireland. \r\n",

                "text": "Theatre-going remained a popular activity during the Napoleonic Wars. On any given night, audiences were presented with a variety of entertainments, as illustrated by this playbill for Covent Garden Theatre, which advertises William Dimond’s comic opera, 'Brother & Sister'; James Kenney’s farce, 'Love, Law, & Physick'; and Isaac Pocock’s melodrama, 'Zembuca; or, The Net-Maker and his Wife'.\r\n\r\n'Zembuca' had premiered the previous week (27 March) and would be performed a total of twenty-eight times that season. While contemporary reviewers took issue with its improbable plot line and inconsistent characterisation, the melodrama’s spectacular effects were unanimously praised. The 'Morning Post' claimed that 'Zembuca' captured ‘the voluptuous splendor of the East’, producing effects ‘little less than magical’.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around the overthrow of unlawful tyrant Zembuca, and concludes with a magnificent storming and destruction of the fortress. The script included a number of moralistic passages: in Act 1, Zembuca’s confidant Korac declares that ‘Zembuca’s tyranny increases daily; the pride of power; urged by the fear of losing it, drives him to acts of desperate oppression’; the hero, Mirza, piously proclaims that it is ‘every honest man’s business, however humble his station, to set his face against tyranny and oppression’. \r\n\r\nSuch statements on the exercise of power and on resistance to tyranny would have resonated with audiences during Napoleon’s 100 Days campaign. \r\n\r\n",

By April 1815, the participating powers had only just committed their armies to upholding the boundaries of the one-year old Treaty of Paris, by which time Napoleon had returned to Paris and taken up the reigns of power again. \r\n\r\nIn this print, ‘The Congress Dissolved Before the Cake Was Cut Up’ (6 April 1815), the twenty-two year old George Cruikshank mocked the ponderous processes and uncompromising self-interest of the participating powers, in contrast to Napoleon’s energetic action. \r\n\r\nHis Napoleon strides in, trampling their decrees and plans, shouting ‘Avast! ye Bunglers; the cake you have been these six months disputing about, the Cutting up I will do in as many hours.’\r\n\r\nTsar Alexander, cutting up the cake of Europe, drops the knife: – ‘Who the Devil would have expected you here – this is mal à propos’; Prussia, with his helping of Saxony, blames the British navy: ‘I thought England had promised to guard him!!!’ Behind, Austria shrieks ‘Hold him, Seize him’; ‘Oh dear! oh dear!’ moans the Pope, ‘what will become of me?’ Sweden’s Bernadotte cries ‘Seize him: kill him.’ But a fur-hatted Poland mutters ‘Who’ll begin? – there’s the rub!!!’ Other figures are the crouching Ferdinand VII, and blue-coated Norway, while Holland squeaks ‘O Donder & Blixen! my Hollands is all gone!’, as his gin spills onto the floor. \r\n\r\nBut facing Napoleon, wearing his own plumed hat, stands one silent figure. Wellington sternly draws his sword: a rather flattering portrayal of British resolve and readiness.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "Fanny Burney was an extremely successful novelist in the 18th century. Her writing career began with 'Evelina', published in 1778, and her last novel, 'The Wanderer' was published in 1814. During the French Revolution she married Alexandre d’Arblay, a French émigré who had taken refuge in Britain. Once Louis XVIII was restored to the throne in 1814, the d’Arblays became part of the circle around the royal family in Paris. When, in March 1815, it became clear that Napoleon was heading for Paris, the d’Arblays were dramatically caught up in events, Alexandre as a member of the King’s household, and Frances as a royalist. Fanny’s letters to her son and to her sister in Britain give us an invaluable eye-witness account of the royalist reaction to Napoleon’s return.\r\nIn this letter from 8th April 1815, we learn of Fanny's hurried departure from Paris for Brussels, and how little she managed to take with her. She recounts how the troops of the King’s household, her husband amongst them, had expected to engage Napoleon’s forces but ended up fleeing instead, leaving behind both baggage and servants. \r\nIn the weeks that followed, Fanny remained in Brussels, where she eagerly awaited news of her husband’s well-being as he undertook a delicate mission to liaise with the Prussians on the King’s behalf. Fanny shares with her family anecdotes about Wellington, Blücher, and other leading figures in Brussels. Once war is imminent she prepares bandages for the inevitable casualties.\r\nFanny’s overriding concern in her correspondence of the spring of 1815 was for news. Her letters are full of her fear for the lives of those she loved and they highlight above all the interminable wait for information that was the lot of women whose menfolk were involved in war.\r\n\r\nA transcription of the letter can be found by clicking on 'further information' below.\r\n",

                "text": "Brussels – April  8th 1815 –\r\nAh, my dearest Esther, when am I to write to you a chearful letter? A Day longer than I was first offered for writing to England being given me, I cannot refuse myself using it to again address you, though still – alas! alas! only in the sackcloth & ashes of grief – distress & alarm! – a frightful paragraph of a contagious fever at Cambridge has chilled my blood, & added so direful a weight to my already so loaded mind that every minute seems to linger out an hour – though I do all, all I can to smother my apprehensions, not further to oppress my Partner in All; himself but just escaped from a malady, the effect of his long fatigues & nearly outrageous exertions, which threatened him with the most serious consequences. I had hardly had time to bless Heaven in grateful fervour for his safety – after critical & dread separation on the 19th of March, when this so unexpected blow came to quash again all remittance from evil! – for the best is but remittance, since the congée of M. d’A has only been granted, or asked, for the recruit of his shattered health, & that he may procure himself a fresh equipment for his military service! all his original most expensive equipment – his papers, Baggage, military Books & stores – his Horses, and his Domestic – All, in short, but his weapons & uniform, have been left en route, at Bethune, near the frontières, whence the whole Maison du Roi, i.e. gardes du corps, issued with the belief of a Battle – which, however, did not take place. The pursuers, Buonaparte’s guards, being but 200, against as many thousand, then making a parade of approach & defiance, suddenly called out vive l’Empereur while the Duc de Berri cried ‘vive le Roi’ - & precipitately fled. It was concluded, however, that this was a feint, & that they had sufficient force near at hand; the Duc, therefore, ordered the Maison du Roi to march on, without stopping to retake either Baggage or Domestic. To us this has been peculiarly unfortunate, for I had already left Paris, with only a handful of linen, & 2 mourning gowns – and now M. d’A. also is robbed of every thing! Yet oh – if of Him & my other Alexander I am not robbed – if once we have a safe re-union in any peaceful spot, away from evolutionary events & sufferings & terrours, - methinks I shall be happy under every privation. – \r\nAdieu! my dearest Esther – my best Love to Mr B who I hope continues mending, and to Amelia - & when you write, to Maria in particular, & to dear Sophy, Cecilia& Fanny – \r\nHow our affairs go on in England I know not - & never yet were money matters so important to me – Not a line has come to me relative to our now unfortunate Cottage – nor to the so long impending 2nd Edition that was sold before publication! nor from Charles for our residu at White’s, Leigh’s, & the Museum! – nor from Mr White for the goods we left to be sold from West-Humble – nor of the Irish business – nor whether the Mortgage of Mr Lewes has been deemed worth struggling for. Certainly we are greatly injured, & in a very considerable Sum (I speak of you & me,) if Mr Lewes keeps a debt so undoubtedly due to our dear Father: Oh, my dear Esther, what a succession of mortal and bodily sufferings have been mine, from the time of his loss, to its anniversary, next Tuesday! I had always kept in mourning, as we had agreed - & 2 mourning Gowns, with a small change of Linnen, is ALL I have saved from all my possessions in Paris! And, since, M. d’A in his short & triste Campaigne, with La Maison du Roi, a tout perdu! – military Equipments – Baggage, Books, Maps, papers, Horses & Domestic &c – all left at Bethune where he thought himself preparing for a Combat!\r\n\r\nVolume 8 of the critical edition of Fanny Burney's letters includes extensive footnotes to explain the socio-political context of 1815 as well as Burney's Waterloo Journal.

Soldiers sporting Phrygian caps and bearing Napoleonic eagles cheer ‘Vive l’Empereur’; a winged black demon pitches a virile Napoleon onto the French throne. As he swaps his bicorne for a crown, Napoleon’s spurred foot boots a treasure-bearing, gouty Louis XVIII into the arms of John Bull (England). His phlegmatic consolation reads, ‘Cheer up old Lewis for as fast as he kicks you down we’ll pop you up again.’ Behind John Bull fly the standards of England, Russia, Prussia – and two unidentified nations (Austria is conspicuously, if unfairly, absent).\r\n\r\nThe subheading ‘A New Song to an Old Tune’ is less practical information, more witty aside: history repeats itself. There is reassurance here, as in the speech above – Britain will deal with the crisis. But the tone is cynical. Yes, the Allies will win again. But the price, once more, is war taxation at home, for John Bull must ‘pay the piper’ and ‘equip and maintain’ the allied armies.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, Napoleon is accompanied by devils in the lyric as in the print, yet the lines are admiring, rather than condemnatory: his ‘wonderful’ luck and skill must come from a Faustian pact. How else could ‘the rogue in his chaise and two pair / Put to flight the French King and his army’?\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "This complex print by Charles Williams depicts Samuel Whitbread’s (verbal) attack on Lord Castlereagh in the House of Commons on 10 April for his part in the negotiations at the Congress of Vienna, and for the declaration of hostilities against Napoleon. <br /><br />Whitbread (1764-1815) had long been an opponent in the House of Commons to the continuation of the war with France, and he became still more agitated and hostile about its resumption on the return of Napoleon. On 7 April he moved a motion deploring British involvement in attempts to determine who should rule France. In the bout with Castlereagh three days later he demanded a full disclosure of Castlereagh’s activities in Vienna.<br /><br /> Whitbread (who inherited his father’s brewing empire) is presented here as a drayman; Castlereagh appears as a gentleman, with the Order of the Garter over his shirt. <br /><br />Williams would use the imagery of boxing on other occasions – notably ‘<a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1481298&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Boxiana,+or+the+Fancy%25u2019+&amp;page=1\">Boxiana, or the Fancy</a>’ (October 1815), depicting Napoleon being kicked when down by the Prince Regent, subsequently George IV. The metaphor was an influential one. Prize fights were major public occasions: Hazlitt’s famous essay ‘The Fight’ records a bout between Bill Neate and Thomas Hickam in November 1821 that was watched by some 22,000 people. <br /><br />The suggestion of cheating in some of William’s captions captures the fragility of the line between acting within the rules, and bending or breaking the rules so as to gain ascendancy, whether in war, in parliamentary controversy or in the sport. <br /><br />For the longer version, including a transcription of the captions in the caricature, see Further Information",

                "text": "This complex print by Charles Williams depicts Samuel Whitbread’s (verbal) attack on Lord Castlereagh in the House of Commons on 10 April for his part in the negotiations at the Congress of Vienna, and for the declaration of hostilities against Napoleon. Whitbread (1764-1815) had long been an opponent in the House of Commons to the continuation of the war with France, and he became still more agitated and hostile about its resumption on the return of Napoleon. On 7 April he moved a motion deploring British involvement in attempts to determine who should rule France. In the bout with Castlereagh three days later he demanded a full disclosure of Castlereagh’s activities in Vienna. Castlereagh is reputed to have responded that ‘To the hon, gentleman it was, no doubt, easier to calumniate his Majesty’s ministers and the Allies of the country on imperfect documents than on full information for experience had shown that when he proceeded on the latter, no one had been less fortunate than the hon. Gentleman in establishing the charges which he thought proper to adduce among public men.’ Whitbread (who inherited his father’s brewing empire) is presented here as a drayman; Castlereagh appears as a gentleman, with the Order of the Garter over his shirt.\r\nWilliams had used the imagery of boxing on other occasions – notably ‘Boxiana, or the Fancy’ (October 1815, BM 12613) depicting Napoleon being kicked when down by the Prince Regent, subsequently George IV. The metaphor was an influential one. Prize fights were major public occasions: Hazlitt’s famous essay ‘The Fight’ records a bout between Bill Neate and Thomas Hickam in November 1821, which was watched by some 22,000 people. The suggestion of cheating in some of William’s captions captures the fragility of the line between acting within the rules, and bending or breaking the rules so as to gain ascendancy – whether in war, in parliamentary controversy or in the sport. \r\nThe print also has a rather more poignant significance. The protagonists died in very similar circumstances. Whitbread suffered deteriorating physical and mental health and on 6 July 1815 he committed suicide by cutting his throat in his London home. Castlereagh went on to follow up Waterloo by negotiating a new peace treaty and alliance in the summer of 1815, but his return to peacetime politics in Britain was marred by a series of controversies – including the use of mounted guardsmen against a peaceful crown in St Peter’s field in Manchester in 1819, dubbed Peterloo – and providing Shelley the occasion for his Masque of Anarchy (1819) and the lines:\r\nI met Murder on the way -\r\nHe had a mask like Castlereagh -\r\nVery smooth he looked, yet grim;\r\nSeven blood-hounds followed him.\r\n\r\nThe strains of political office finally broke Castlereagh; he showed increasing evidence of mental instability and in August 1822, he too committed suicide by cutting his throat.\r\nMale suicide involving cutting of the throat seems to have been a common method in this period, although the problems of recording make it difficult to assess whether it was more or less common than using a gun, slashing one’s wrists, or using drugs. Its use may partly have been a matter of opportunity – the razor was ubiquitous and to hand. But it raises questions about how far this means might have been considered an honourable course; or whether in fact, it was the confluence of instrument, mirror, reflection, and inner torment that led to its adoption. It is notable that Napoleon’s one suicide attempt was with poison. And it is not clear that in France the throat was especially favoured as a target for self-destruction. So this may have been a national predilection. Montesquieu claimed in L’Esprit des Lois (1748) that the English were especially prone to suicide: he made no comment the question of method, but attributed the high rate to the English weather. \r\nFrom left to right the captions are: \r\nHiley Addington (represented as one of Castlereagh’s seconds) clutches a bottle of Curracoa (representing Curaçoa, an island off South America which was originally colonised by the Dutch but which changed hands on several occasions in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars before returning to Dutch control after Waterloo in 1815) and shouts: That’s a prime facer, there goes the Brewer.\r\nBackbenchers comment: Lombard Street to china orange (a phrase for uneven odds, contrasting the wealth of Lombard Street in the banking sector of the City of London, with a china orange signifying poverty) and: I knew Sam had no chance from the beginning of the battle, he hit at random.\r\nAnother responds: Why Sir if you observed he more than once pinked Brother Hiley the bottleholder instead of aiming his blows at Bob. Sam is a glutton, but has no more science than Ikey Pig. Tho he has gained easy victories over some provincial novices at th fairs at Bedford. He is not able to contend with tip top professors.\r\n[Whitbread’s bottle holder carries a cask inscribed Entire W. ‘Entire’ refers to the beer brewed by Whitbread’s throughout the 19th century]\r\n\r\nHis second, concerned, says: Zounds Man you should have guarded your jaw better why that left handed facer will floor you.\r\nTwo backbenchers exchange comments: Who would have thought it! Sure Sam has not been in proper training. / No he has’ent taken brown stout enough!\r\nThe base of the print contains a ‘match report’\r\n1st Round. No sparring – Sam set too, without much ceremony. He made three or four hanging hits at Bob Stewart (alias bit of Blue)’s head; but it was evident he misjudged his distance terribly. Sam acted in this round quite on the offensive, tho’ he shifted his ground constantly, and threw many hits away right and left. Towards the end of the round he lost his temper, tried a cross buttock but failed; and after an irregular struggle was thrown on his back against the ropes.- \r\n2nd Round . in this round the Irishman showed himself a flash man, and as cool and determined a pugilist as was ever pittied [sic]; he sparred cautiously at first, parried all Sam’s hits with much dexterity, and punished him about the head and body with the greatest good humour. Sam seemed uneasy at this treatment; and at length Bob Stewart (alias bit of blue) took compassion on him, and planted a left handed facer on Sams jaw, which floored him and put an end to the round – Lombard Street to a china Orange against Sam. – \r\n3rd Round , Sam rallied and sprung on his legs with much gaiety; his wind seemed untouched, and his jaw stronger than ever; he affected to make play but the Irishman smiled with confidence. Sam tried to pink him below the waist; loud cries of “foul, foul,” which Sam disregarded, and the battle went on, until the Irishman fibbed him severely, and Sams friends took him out of the ring.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "<p>On 5 April 1815, a truly seismic event sent shock waves around the world: not a returning emperor, but the eruption of Mount Tambora on island of Sumbawa, in modern-day Indonesia. One of the best English-language accounts comes from the memoirs of Sir Stamford Raffles (1781-1826) who was stationed in nearby Java. By the time Raffles sailed for home the following year – stopping off to meet Bonaparte in St Helena – over 100,000 people had lost their lives to Tambora’s eruption and the more deadly tsunami that followed. This was only the beginning: 1816 became known throughout the world as the “year without a summer” on account of the unprecedented volume of ash in the atmosphere, which wreaked havoc on crops from Ireland to China and to the fledgling United States; volatility in food markets led to financial panic before the decade was out; and floods in the Bay of Bengal fostered a deadly cholera epidemic that would overshadow much of the rest of the century.<br /><br />Like military reports from the same period, Raffles’ account reveals a sense of foreboding power and unfathomable energy, marking a moment in which eruption and revolution were more than metaphorically linked. Indeed, the “explosions” of geological activity were initially mistaken for warfare: “The noise was, in the first instance, almost universally attributed to distant cannon; so much so, that a detachment of troops were marched from Djocjocarta, in the expectation that a neighbouring post was attacked.” In this globalising era of human conflict, personified most forcefully by Napoleon’s exploits, it is hardly surprising that the sound of the earth’s movement could be mistaken for enemy combat.</p>",

In 1815 Raffles was reeling not only from the death of his wife the previous year, but also from the loss of his role as Lieutenant-General of Java, since the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 had removed the territory from British control. This was a clear example of power-struggles in the wake of Napoleon’s campaigns having a direct impact, half way round the globe, on the governance and exploitation of Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Further reading</strong></p>\n<p>Gillen D’Arcy Wood. <em>Tambora: The Eruption That Changed the World</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014)<br /><br />Raffles, Sophia, and Raffles, Thomas Stamford.<em> Memoir of the life and public services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, F.R.S. &amp;c.: particularly in the government of Java, 1811-1816, and of Bencoolen and its dependencies, 1817-1824: with details of the commerce and resources of the eastern archipelago, and selections from his correspondence</em> (London, John Murray, 1830)</p>\nSir Stamford Raffles also gave the following account of the explosion:<br /><br />\"To preserve an authentic account of the violent and extraordinary eruption of the Tomboro Mountain on Sambawa, in April last, I required from the several Residents of districts on this Island a statement of the circumstances that occurred within their knowledge; and from their replies the following narrative is collected. It is, perhaps, incomplete until some further accounts are received of the immediate effects upon the mountain itself; but the progress is sufficiently known to render interesting a present account of the phenomenon, which exceeds any one of a similar description on record. The first explosions were heard on this Island in the evening of the 5th of April, they were noticed in every quarter, and continued at intervals until the following day. The noise was, in the first instance, almost universally attributed to distant cannon ; so much so, that a detachment of troops were marched from Djocjocarta, in the expectation that a neighbouring post was attacked, and along the coast boats were in two instances dispatched in quest of a supposed ship in distress. [...]<br /><br /> EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM SUMANAP<br />'On the evening of the 10th the explosions became very loud; one in particular shook the town, and they were excessively quick, resembling a heavy cannonade. Towards evening, next day, the atmosphere thickened so much, that by four o'clock it was necessary to light candles. At about seven p.m., of the llth, the tide being about ebb, a rush of water from the bay occasioned the river to rise four feet and it subsided again in about four minutes; the bay was much agitated about this time, and was illuminated from a northerly direction. On the island of Sahotie, fire was seen distinctly at a short distance to the south-east. The uncommon darkness of this night did not break till ten and eleven, A.M., of the 12th, and it could hardly be called day-light all day. Volcanic ashes fell in abundance, and covered the earth about two inches thick, the trees also were loaded with them.'<br /><br />EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM BANYUWANGI<br />'At ten, P. M. of the 1st of April, we heard a noise resembling a cannonade, which lasted, at intervals, till nine o'clock next day; it continued at times loud, at others resembling distant thunder; but on the night of the 10th, the explosions became truly tremendous, frequently shaking the earth and sea violently. Towards morning they again slackened, and continued to lessen gradually till the 14th, when they ceased altogether. On the morning of the 3rd of April, ashes began to fall like fine snow; and in the course of the day they were half-an-inch deep on the ground. From that time till the 11th the air was constantly impregnated with them to such a degree, that it was unpleasant to stir out of doors. On the morning of the 11th, the opposite shore of Bali was completely obscured in a dense cloud, which gradually approached the Java shore, and was dreary and terrific. By one, P. M., candles were necessary; by four, P.M., it was pitch-dark; and so it continued until two o'clock of the afternoon of the 12th, ashes continuing to fall abundantly: they were eight inches in depth at this time.'\"",

                "text": "Housed in a former theatre, the Café Montansier had by mid-March become <em>the</em> place to gather to sing pro-Napoleonic songs, and according to some accounts, it was at this café that the first bouquets of violets were handed out as a Bonapartist badge (see entries for 3 and 20 March). As befitted the venue, the café also hosted small theatrical performances, including this vaudeville, <em>Le royaliste converti</em>. While the term vaudeville would later refer to a variety show, in early nineteenth-century France it referred to a dramatic work in which all the songs were set to old tunes. In the script you can see that only the words are included, and the melody simply named<br /><br /><em>Le royaliste converti</em>, performed on 12 April 1815 – after Napoleon has arrived in Paris – is a conversation between a ‘patriot’ and a ‘royalist’, in which the patriot gradually convinces the royalist of the Napoleonic cause. They speculate as to the reaction of the allies to Bonaparte’s return to Paris, with each described in turn by the patriot in a song (for texts and recordings of the Russian and British songs shown in the second image, see ‘Further Information’). Once the Bonapartist has compared Louis XVIII and Napoleon, the royalist begins to be converted to the latter – and only then does he begin to sing, declaring himself at the end of the sketch to be no more a royalist, but a Frenchman (and therefore, by implication, a Bonapartist).",

In particular, he employs the set characters and situations of the harlequinade, a form of entertainment based on the Italian commedia dell’arte that had been popular on the British stage since the early eighteenth century. Characterized by slapstick, gross humour, the inversions of norms and conventions, and magical transformations, the harlequinade was fraught with satirical potential. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this form, as well as Rowlandson’s picture, is Harlequin himself, who is usually possessed of magic powers enabling him to transform objects and thus change the turn of events (and, in 1815, these metamorphic tricks were the stock-in-trade of Joseph Grimaldi, the acclaimed ‘King of Clowns’). Rowlandson accordingly depicts Napoleon as a Harlequin who, after escaping from Elba, has set in train some sudden and dramatic transformations on the political stage of Europe, and is chased by a horde of antagonists bent on punishing him. \r\n",

                "text": "Among Napoleon's antagonists in this print is the obese King of Würtemberg, who is pictured on his knees and in the act of firing a pair of pistols at the puny anti-hero. The king’s posterior bears the word ‘Clown’, indicating that Napoleon’s magic trick has revealed the monarchs of Europe for what they really are. \r\n\r\nAnother grotesque pursuer is the Emperor of Austria, who wears a wallet in his belt inscribed ‘Pantaloon’. The only figures who are not identified with a character from the harlequinade, but rather as more generic stage types, are a fat Cossack (representing Russia) and Ferdinand VII of Spain, depicted as a ‘Don’ in slashed doublet, cloak and flapped boots. The latter image is particularly relevant because it stresses how durable stereotypical representations of Spanishness continued to be even after the wave of pro-Spanish feeling introduced by the early phases of the Peninsular War. It also confirms that, in early 1815, Spain still played a role in the theatre of European politics and diplomacy – a role it would lose after Waterloo and Vienna, when it became one of Europe’s ‘secondary courts’. \r\n\r\nFinally, the print features another crucial figure from the harlequinade, that of Columbine, in the painting of a buxom woman with arms akimbo, which is being stolen by some anonymous hands (this female figure has been variously interpreted as Napoleon’s wife, Marie Louise of Austria, or the powerful Duchesse d’Angoulême). \r\n\r\nRowlandson’s print pokes fun at the Continent’s monarchs and a tottering ‘new’ order that is in chaos because of the unexpected interference of the troublesome little Corsican. By harnessing the arts of theatre and caricature, it conjures up a ‘carnivalized’ depiction of Europe at the start of the Hundred Days. Britain, however, is significantly excluded from this image, its satire being exclusively levelled at Continental powers. In addition, there seems to be some degree of sympathy for Napoleon and his mischievous ability to overturn the order imposed by the 1814 Treaty of Paris and cause havoc among the buffoon-like (old, though ostensibly new) rulers of Europe. Rowlandson represents his indictment of the Restoration also in the portrait/caricature of Louis XVIII (inscribed ‘Louis le Bien Aimé’), through which Harlequin Napoleon jumps out of the stage to safety. In this confused freeze-frame, the obese figure of the ‘beloved’ Bourbon, the grotesque features of his fellow monarchs, and the figure of the Pope holding an executioner’s axe, are all caught in a transitional and suspended position – between farce and tragedy – that transforms the light-hearted tone of the harlequinade into a pitilessly sarcastic denunciation of the disastrous state of post-Napoleonic Europe.\r\n",

                "text": "Le double serment; ou, fidélité constante à tout le monde\r\n\r\nOn 14 April 1815, Napoleon summoned Benjamin Constant to deliberate with him on a revised constitution for the Empire, so heralding his much-debated liberal turn. There followed a week of intense debate, culminating in the publication of the Acte additionnel in the Moniteur of 23 April (though in the course of those days Constant also found the time to give a reading of his as yet unpublished novel 'Adolphe' in Madame Récamier’s salon). \r\n\r\nConstant’s collaboration with Napoleon was long to haunt him, as this print makes clear. It was published in 'La Foudre', a royalist paper, in 1822. On the eve of Napoleon’s entry into Paris, Constant had rallied to the Bourbons and denounced the Emperor as a latter-day Attila. A month later, he was nominated to the Conseil d’État: this is what the print purports to depict, alongside the disaster which Napoleon’s ‘invasion’ represented in Royalist eyes. Constant was at pains to justify his apparent volte-face in the 'Mémoires sur les Cent-Jours', to this day a major historical source: only Napoleon, he concluded, could save France from invasion and here too was an opportunity for the Emperor to reinvent himself as a constitutional leader. \r\n\r\nThe Acte additionnel would come to nothing and by 1822 Napoleon was in his grave. But the politics of the Restoration were indelibly marked by the encounter which was briefly to make him Constant’s disciple. \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "By 1822, Constant was well established as the pivotal figure in the liberal opposition. Thus Antoine Madrolle’s entry on him in Michaud’s Biographie universelle: ‘Son âge, sa capacité, l’ironie de ses attaques, qu’il avait apprise à l’école de Voltaire, enfin sa renommée, ses fautes même, d’une nature et d’une gravité unique, l’en firent le chef’. <br /><br />This print was published by Villain; the date of the dépôt légal is 18 May 1822 and it is mentioned in the Bibliographie de la France for that year (the plate measures 32 x 24.9 cm; the image, 26.5 x 22 cm). It appeared in the same month in number 74 of La Foudre, a royalist paper published by Alphonse de Beauchamp. <br /><br />The image juxtaposes the happy state of France until the flight of the King on 19 March, the date on which Constant had published his denunciation of Napoleon (on the left) with the chaos that had befallen the nation by the time when Constant became a member of the Conseil d’État on 20 April (on the right). Constant is depicted with Foy, Girardin and Manuel, all liberal collaborators of his in the second Restoration. Each of these figures is identified in a minutely detailed satirical commentary which accompanies the image in La Foudre, where the central protagonist is cryptically named as Biengamin Content. <br /><br />Constant and Manuel were also satirized in number 87, where the former is represented as a chameleon: ‘Tous les ans il redevient blanc au 19 mars et tricolore au 20. […] Dans tous les troubles il fait acte de présence et quelquefois un acte additionnel’. In Le Double Serment, however, the significance of the animal imagery remains latent. <br /><br />Like this print, much of the iconography of the meeting between Constant and Napoleon on 14 April, including well-known prints made from works by Philippoteaux, is retrospective, testifying to the extent to which from this point onwards Constant’s legend is invaded by that of Napoleon. A final meeting with ‘l’Attila vaincu’ (a phrase we owe also to Madrolle) took place on 24 June 1815, just before Napoleon’s departure from Paris. <br /><br />Some sources <br /><br />Constant’s writings span more than thirty years and many of them are now available in Gallica: see <a href=\"http://data.bnf.fr/fr/11886006/benjamin_constant/%20\">here<br /></a><br />His denunciation of Napoleon appeared in the <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4212175.r=19+mars+1815.langEN%20\">Journal des débats of 19 March 1815 </a><br /><br />Constant’s reading of Adolphe on 19 April 1815 was to become legendary, owing to the account given by Victor de Broglie in his <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k36407j/f403.image.r=.langFR\">Souvenirs</a> of the febrile atmosphere in which it was received (the novel was first published in London and in Paris in the following year) <br /><br /> <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1054550d\">Mémoires sur les Cent-Jours</a> ; a modern edition prepared by Kurt Kloocke forms volume 14 of Constant’s Œuvres complètes (Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1993); Constant’s journal intime covers the Hundred Days and is to be found in volume 7 of the Œuvres complètes (2005) <br /> <br /><br />La Foudre<br /> (one of four volumes; includes no. 74, but Villain’s ‘lythographie’ is absent from this <a href=\"http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/555012582.pdf\">digital edition</a>) <br /><br />(<a href=\"http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/555012584.pdf%20\">includes no. 87</a>) <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=1161240&amp;objectId=3441101&amp;partId=1%20\">Napoleon meets Constant</a>, following Philippoteaux <br /><br />Michaud, <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k516497/f81.image.r=.langFR%20\">Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne</a>, second edition, vol. 9 <br /><br />In an entry on Constant in his <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204907x/f461.image.r=.langFR%20\">Biographie moderne</a>, published in 1815, Alexis Eymery used the word ‘invasion’ to describe Napoleon’s return from Elba (vol. 1) <br /><br />It was Léon Radiguet who first described Napoleon as Constant’s disciple, in <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5463899f/f14.image\">L’Acte additionnel aux constitutions de l'Empire du 22 avril 1815</a> (1911)",

                "text": "In April 1815 Petronella Moens (1762-1843), one of the best known Dutch women writers of the time, published a poem entitled ‘Bij het intrekken van Napoleon Buonaparte in Parijs’ (‘On Napoleon Bonaparte’s entering of Paris’). This poem is of particular interest because of the female perspective: not only is it written by a woman, but there is also ample attention to the emotions of women confronted with the possibility of a new war against Napoleon. \r\n\r\nMoens’ main goal is to spread feelings of patriotism amongst her fellow-countrymen: she encourages all Dutch men to join the allied forces. To make her address stronger she includes emotional appeals from three different groups: fathers, mothers and wives, and young girls of marriageable age (‘the Dutch virgins’). Each one of these groups in turn makes an emotional appeal to the men to leave their loved ones behind to serve their country. Consequently, the role of women in this poem is to overcome their fears, and to encourage their husbands and sons to join the fight. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the poem is that there can be no doubt that the allies will be able to defeat Napoleon, with the support of the beloved father of the Dutch nation, King William, and with God on their side.",

                "text": "William Dickinson was one of the foremost English engravers in mezzotint and during the 1780s had established a substantial business in London as a print seller and publisher with a shop in Bond Street. He had suffered in the harsh economic climate of the late 1790s, however, and went bankrupt: his move to Paris in 1802 was probably for economic reasons, although as a pupil of the radical painter Robert Edge Pine, and someone who cast his vote for Fox in Westminster elections, political sympathies may have played a part. \r\n\r\nIn Paris Dickinson published a number of important prints, often reproducing the paintings of François Gérard, as in this mezzotint. One of the earliest was of the large portrait of Napoleon as First Consul that Bonaparte had commissioned from Antoine Gros, published in October 1803. Dickinson established a business in the rue du Bac and exhibited at the Salons of 1808, 1810 and 1812. \r\n\r\nThe date of Gérard’s original painting of Napoleon is unknown, but Dickinson’s mezzotint of it appears to have been published on 6 April 1815: nineteen new portraits of the Emperor were listed in the Bibliographie de la France in March and April 1815, clearly an attempt to capitalize on his return. \r\n\r\nIn this one, Napoleon is wearing the uniform of colonel of the Foot Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard and the Grand Cross of the Légion d’Honneur.\r\n",

                "text": "On 17 April 1815 Napoleon moved his residence from the Tuileries. This palace had been built as a domestic residence under the orders of Catherine De’ Medici in the 1570s and connected by a gallery to the Louvre under Henri IV.  The Louvre subsequently acted as the formal office of the state with the Tuileries as a domestic residence for the King when in Paris. \r\n\r\nVincent Cronin has suggested that Napoleon moved from the Tuileries to the smaller Élysée palace once it became clear that his wife, Marie Louise and their young son Napoleon, King of Rome, were not going to join him in Paris.  While in exile, Marie Louise had first vacillated about whether to join her husband in Elba and had then been suborned in Vienna by an affair with Count Adam Adelbert von Neipperg (who was acting in part on Metternich’s instructions). She failed to answer Napoleon’s letters, and never communicated with him again.  \r\n\r\nHis wife’s abandonment, and the absence of his son (now firmly under Austrian control), despite direct pleas for their return to Napoleon’s side, made the Tuileries, in which the couple had lived when in Paris since their marriage in 1810, seem deserted. The Élysée palace, was smaller and had fewer associations with the first years of Napoleon’s largely happy second marriage. \r\n",

It was constructed between 1718 and 1722 by Mollet  for the son in law of the Comte d’Évreux. and in the 1740s became the Parisian residence of the Marquise de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. It was taken into public ownership during the revolution and subsequently sold to the revolutionary general Joachim Murat in 1805. \r\n\r\nMurat had married Napoleon’s sister, Caroline Bonaparte, in 1800, and played an important part in several of Napoleon’s campaigns. When he was made King of Naples in 1808, secret protocols of agreement transferred all Murat’s French properties into the care of Napoleon as a surety for good conduct. The palace’s name seems to have been changed under Napoleon to the Élysée-Napoléon.  Napoleon lived their briefly in 1809, subsequently permitting his first wife Josephine to use it. He resumed control of it in 1812.  \r\n\r\nAfter his defeat at Waterloo, on 22 June 1815 Napoleon signed his abdication as Emperor in the palace’s Boudoir d'Argent.  The palace has been the official residence for the President of the French Republic since 1873.\r\n\r\nFurther reading\r\nVincent Cronin, Napoleon (London, 1994), p. 398.  \r\n\r\n",

(London, 1815)\r\n\r\n‘Peter Pindar’ was the pseudonym of several of London’s satirical poets, in this case C.F. Lawler, especially prolific in 1814-15 and known for his tirades against the Prince Regent. \r\n\r\nFresh from lampooning the Congress of Vienna in The German Sausages, Lawler responded to the news of Napoleon’s return with a gleeful attack on both Louis XVIII – derided as the Corsican’s ‘warming-pan’, simply keeping the throne toasty – and on the British tourists also forced to flee Paris (for an extract, see ‘Further Information’. \r\n\r\nLawler turns the hyperbole of xenophobic English attacks on Napoleon against that same society, glorying in the cowardly retreat of London’s elite in the face of the ‘bugabo’.\r\n\r\nLawler’s printer is John Fairburn, who also published the broadside ‘The Bungling Tinkers!’, which shared this wry, cynical sentiment. In this poem, Lawler does not merely react to the news as mediated by the London press; he caricatures the sale of those very papers. \r\n\r\nSeveral lively verses send up the confusion and excitement that met the news of Napoleon’s escape, when the Courier was sold by post-boys for up to half-a-crown, five times the official price of sixpence, so eager were Londoners to know the ‘truth’ of events in France.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "For a man famously hailed by Stendhal in 1824 as the new Napoleon, conquering the world with his music, Gioachino Rossini was notably unwilling to engage with the grand political struggles of his day.  But in a letter written in 1864, just a few years before his death, and in the midst of the final push towards Italian unification, Rossini took issue with his reputation as a reactionary.  \r\n\r\nIn 1815, he pointed out, he had composed a Hymn to Independence (to a text by Giovanni Battista Giusti), and that when he conducted it, the word ‘indipendenza’ had ‘aroused lively enthusiasm as intoned by me in my then resonant voice and repeated by the people, choruses, etc.’ \r\n\r\nThe work’s background was simple enough: on Napoleon’s escape from Elba, his brother-in-law Joachim Murat, ex-King of Naples, declared war on Austria, and on 30 March gave the Rimini proclamation, calling for Italian independence.  In Bologna, Austrian forces were briefly defeated, inspiring the performance of Rossini’s Hymn in the Teatro Catavalli on 15 April, in the presence of Murat himself: just one day later the Austrians retook the city; the music is now lost.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Rossini was put under suspicion (and possibly arrested) by the Austrian authorities.  But an anecdote later spread that Rossini promptly reset the music to pro-Austrian lyrics, to gain free passage to leave the city, as recounted in Eugene de Mirecourt’s later biography 'Rossini' (Paris: Gustave Harvard, 1855).\r\n\r\nContested by later biographers (and by Rossini himself), the anecdote's widespread appeal is nonetheless telling; both in its characterisation of the composer’s eye to expediency, and to the piquancy of handing over to the bands of the Austrian army the exact music that days before had momentarily served as an Italian Marseillaise.\r\n\r\n",

Louis asks, ‘Is it almost full?’ and a soldier answers, ‘There will be room for everything,’ as he adds a list of soldiers who died for their country to the Constitutional Charter that he has just pushed into the extinguisher.

                "text": "These three folios held by the Curzon Collection (dated April 1815) contain the notes of Lazare Carnot, Interior Minister during the 100 Days, who sat on the special commission for the creation of a new French constitution. Given the three weeks or so between the creation of the constitutional commission and the first draft (drawn up by Benjamin Constant – see the entry for 14 April), the committee had the time to discuss and disagree about how to go about their task. \r\n\r\nThe majority proposed a constitution based on Louis XVIII’s Charte and on the British constitution. Carnot alone rejected this approach. Here he notes how the British representative system of equilibrium, with an opposition party, would be impossible for France. Such an opposition, he thought, had always taken advantage of moments of crisis to overthrow the legislative and executive power. The French system had to be one of national unity, avoiding a system of denunciation which would enflame passions. There could be no equilibrium as in Britain. \r\n\r\nAll the powers had to be entirely separate, dealing with different issues. The Senate though had the power of censure. Appointments for the latter body, he proposed, should be by the Emperor alone – it would be an important political lever for him –, but senators should not be hereditary. The 123 names which close the document – his suggestions for inclusion in the Senate – include some surprising figures from the pre-Consular and Imperial days, notably ideologues such as Antoine Destutt Tracy and Alexandre Lameth and liberals such as Lafayette.\r\n\r\nFor more on the constitution, click on ‘Further information’ below.\r\n",

                "text": "In the first days of his return to the Tuileries, Napoleon was forced to come to terms with the proclamations he had made in Lyons on the way back to power, proclamations that had verged on the Jacobin in their opposition to Louis XVIII and his ‘Charte’ or Charter. A new constitution was the key, a document that would establish Napoleon as a ‘new and improved’ monarch. \r\n\r\nA special commission was set up to draw up the new founding text. And in his desire to show himself as ‘liberal’, Napoleon had assembled a group largely composed of moderates, namely, Cambacérès, Maret, Carnot, Regnaud de Saint-Jean-d’Angely, Boulay-de-la-Meurthe, Merlin-de-Douai and Defermon. These men were to draw up a constitution that would be submitted to the Conseil d’Etat and then put before a plebiscite. At this point, however, Napoleon dropped a bombshell and approached a special constitutional trouble shooter in the form the arch-liberal and arch-enemy of his, Benjamin Constant, the would-be lover of Germaine de Staël and fierce opponent of the Imperial regime up to its end in 1814. \r\n\r\nExtraordinarily, Constant accepted the challenge, and after several meetings with Napoleon, it was his constitutional document which was presented (first draft on 15 April) to the constitutional committee and then to the Conseil d’Etat – where the text met with one or two amendments. Given the three weeks or so between the creation of the constitutional commission and Constant’s first draft, the committee therefore had had the time to discuss and disagree about how to go about their task. The majority proposed a constitution based on Louis XVIII’s Charte and on the British constitution. Carnot alone rejected this approach, claiming that a continental power could not permit itself to adopt a constitution which could only work on an island unthreatened by land armies. \r\n\r\nFor Carnot, the salvation lay in the complete separation of the bodies of the state – namely, the Emperor (chosen by the people), the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. As he claimed in his notes, only the complete separation of the intermediary bodies beneath the emperor would avoid the disasters of the Revolutionary years of 1790-99. However, others in power, notably Fouché, saw Carnot as an ineffectual utopian and no longer the brilliant ‘organiser of victory’ of 1793. Indeed, the commission followed Constant’s ‘improved Charte’ as Chateaubriand called it, with its deliberative chambers, elected by as large a constituency as possible, its hereditary peerage, and its guaranteed rights and liberties. \r\n\r\nNapoleon however, on many of the points, had the final word, most notably on the confiscation of the property of those who followed Louis XVIII into exile and in the title of the document. The name “Act additional to the constitutions of the Empire” was his express wish; it would, he thought, umbilically link the two regimes, despite the reticence of the commission and Constant. By this act alone, Napoleon left himself open the criticism that in fact nothing had changed, and he had remained the same Napoleon who had led France down into the First Abdication. The ‘Acte additionnel’ was finally signed on 22 April 1815 and published the following day.\r\n",

A year later, however, Constant could not resist the Emperor’s invitation to draw up a new French constitution. Napoleon knew that to rally support after returning from Elba, he needed to embrace the revolutionary heritage, and pose as the defender of liberty against the Bourbons and the crowned heads of Europe.\r\n\r\nConstant’s document, although purportedly a simple “addition” to the earlier imperial constitutions, in fact constituted a blueprint for a liberal constitutional monarchy. Unlike its Napoleonic predecessors, it contained a declaration of rights, with guarantees for press and religious freedom. It also ruled out any reversal of revolutionary land reform, attributed real power to an elected Chamber of Representatives, and allowed for an extension of the suffrage.\r\n\r\n Napoleon signed the acte additionnel on 22 April 1815 and submitted the constitution, quickly nicknamed “la benjamine” after its author, to a plebiscite. Scarcely twenty percent of those eligible actually voted, but the government nonetheless hailed its approval. The re-restored Louis XVIII (“Louis deux fois neuf”) abolished it after Waterloo, but it served as an inspiration for later French constitutions, especially that of 1830.\r\n",

                "text": "Napoleon attended the performance of Jean-Charles-Julien Luce de Lancival’s tragedy 'Hector' (1809) on the 21st April 1815, and the event was reviewed in the Feuilleton of the Journal de l’Empire on 23rd April 1815. \r\n\r\nThe article describes how the audience instinctively knew that Napoleon would be there that evening: whilst waiting, they sang military songs in a theatre full to the brim. In fact, the tragedy commenced without the Emperor, who eventually arrived in a very theatrical manner in Act I Scene 3, whereupon the actors restarted the play. \r\n\r\nThe article reproduced the lines particularly seized upon by the audience, extrapolating their meanings for the far greater audience of readers. The author of the review even makes Napoleon and Hector speak the same lines. He writes ‘le monarque […] dit aujourd’hui comme Hector...’ – the monarch says today, like Hector – \r\n“Quel que soit à mes yeux l’attrait de la victoire,\r\nRendre heureux mon pays, est ma première gloire”\r\n(‘Whatever the attraction of victory to my eyes, \r\nMaking my country happy is my ultimate glory’).\r\n\r\nThe critic thereby insinuates that these are Napoleon’s words, rather than those of the onstage Hector. The review ends with the final word of ‘avenir’ (‘the future’). The political ramifications are clear: the theatre, both in performance and in its associated material such as reviews, was a crucial site for Napoleon’s political power.\r\n\r\nFor a transcription of the review, click on further information.\r\n",

                "text": "THEATRE FRANÇAIS\r\nHector.\r\n\r\nHector dormoit oublié dans le répertoire. Le public, sur l’annonce assez subite de la reprise de cette tragédie, avoit pressenti que l’Empereur en honoreroit la représentation de sa présence ; on connoissoit la bienveillance de S. M. pour cet ouvrage ; on se rappeloit que cette bienveillance, qui ne fut jamais stérile pour les gens de lettres, s’étoit manifestée envers Luce de Lancival par des bienfaits dont une mort prématurée ne lui a pas permis de recueillir longtemps le fruit, mais qui, par une disposition spéciale, lui ont survécu du moins en partie, et subsistent encore aujourd’hui dans sa famille ce pressentiment explique le concours immense de curieux qui, plusieurs heures avant l’ouverture des bureaux, en assiégoient les issues : jamais même, dans sa nouveauté, Hector n’avait appelé une semblable affluence, ni excité un pareil empressement. \r\n\r\nEn un quart d’heure, toutes les places de la salle ont été remplies ; les musiciens ont été forcés de transporter leurs instrumens sur le théâtre ; l’intérieur des coulisses, déjà encombré de Grecs et de Troyens, a reçu néanmoins encore un renfort de spectateurs français : l’assemblée étoit au plus grand complet ; mais il y manquoit un homme !\r\n\r\nPour charmer son impatience, le public a demandé à la musique les airs qui ont conduit tant de fois nos soldats à la victoire. Ils ont été entendus, applaudis avec transport, et souvent même répétés en chorus. Au milieu de cette effervescence patriotique, quelques personnes ont cru reconnoître au balcon M. Gavaudan, acteur du théâtre Feydeau. A l’instant, on l’a invité à chanter quelques couplets analogues au sentiment qui dominoit dans l’assemblée M. Gavaudan s’est rendu de bonne grâce à l’invitation, et d’une voix forte et expressive, il a entonné une ronde assez animée, dont il avoit déjà, il y a quelques jours, égayé un repas donné par la garde nationale à la garde de l’Empereur. Au milieu de ce joyeux passetemps, l’heure s’écouloit ; S. M. n’étoit point encore arrivée : on levoit le rideau, et l’on commençoit à craindre que les espérances conçues ne fussent pas réalisées.\r\n\r\nCependant, à la troisième scène, l’Empereur a paru au milieu des acclamations et des applaudissemens unanimes de l’assemble. Les acteurs, sans attendre que le public exprimât son vœu, se sont retirés et ont recommencé la pièce. \r\n\r\nIl est peu d’ouvrages qui, dans les conjonctures graves où nous nous trouvons, donnent lieu à des allusions plus naturelles et à des appli-[p.2]cation [sic] plus faciles : aussi toutes celles qui sont présentées ont-elles été saisies. Je me contenterai de citer les plus remarquables.\r\n\r\nAndromaque détourne Hector d’aller combattre Achille:\r\n\t\t\tHECTOR\r\n\t\tJe ne suis point à moi, je suis a [sic] la patrie.\r\n\t\t\tANDROMAQUE\r\n\t\tMais ton Astyanax a des droits à la vie. \r\n\t\t\tHECTOR\r\n\t\tIl en aura peut-être à l’immortalité,\r\n\t\tS’il imite son père.\r\n\r\nEncore un passage qui a été vivement senti ; c’est, dans la belle scène des adieux, le moment où Hector exprime sa tendresse et ses vœux pour le jeune héritier de ses destinées :\r\n\t\tSi l’ordre du destin nous sépare aujourd’hui,\r\n\t\tPour vous servir encor que je revive en lui !\r\n\t\tS’il règne, qu’il soit juste, et, s’il le faut, sévère ;\r\n\t\tQu’il fasse tout le bien que j’aurois voulu faire!\r\n\t\tQu’il voue à la partie et son bras et son cœur ;\r\n\t\tQu’armé pour elle seule, il soit toujours vainqueur !\r\n\tLuce qui, dans sa préface, reconnoît avoir tant d’obligations à Homère, dont le génie l’a quelquefois heureusement inspiré, ne pouvoit oublier ce trait sublime où le prince des poëtes nous représente son héros apparoissant comme un fantôme brillant à l’armée des Grecs, les ralliant par le son de sa voix terrible, par ce cri, qui, répété trois fois, porte l’épouvante et le désordre dans l’armée troyenne. L’application s’offroit d’elle-même :\r\n\t\tComme un colosse immense, à l’armée immobile,\r\nApparoît un guerrier.\r\nPATROCLE\r\nC’est lui.\r\nANDROMAQUE\r\nC’est Achille ?\r\nPARIS\r\nC’étoit lui.\r\nHECTOR\r\nPoursuivez.\r\nPARIS\r\nPoint d’armes dans sa main.  \r\n\r\nNe semble-t-il pas que le poëte, par une espèce d’instinct prop[...]tique, ait tracé le tableau de l’événement prodigieux dont nous [...] nous d’être les témoins ? Hector, ravi de retrouver un adversaire digne de lui, s’écrie :\r\n\t\tIl reparoît enfin !\r\nLe public, en détournant le sens qu’ont ces trois mots dans la bouche du personnage, les a reportés, dans une acceptation de respect et d’enthousiasme, vers le monarque qui dit aujourd’hui comme Hector :\r\n\t\tQuel que soit à mes yeux l’attrait de la victoire,\r\n\t\tRendre heureux mon pays, est ma première gloire :\r\nvers le prince qui fonde sa puissance sur le règne des lois, et sur la base inébranlable de la liberté publique.\r\n\r\nS. M. s’est retirée immédiatement après la tragédie : mais avant de sortir, toujours attentive à encourager les arts et les talens [il] a chargé son commissaire près le Théâtre Français de témoigner [sa] satisfaction aux acteurs chargés des principaux rôles. Pour Talma, Lafon, Damas, cet auguste suffrage est une justice rigoureuse ; [il] s’est étendu plus loin, j’ose penser qu’une généreuse indulgence [a] eu part, et que ce qui est une récompense méritée pour les premiers ne doit être pour les autres qu’un encouragement, et un motif [pe]sant de s’en rendre dignes à l’avenir. \r\n",

Fouché planned and led these brutal killings using grapeshot, earning himself the title of ‘The Executioner of Lyons.’ In the same year he voted for the execution of Louis XVI. It is unsurprising, therefore, that Fouché found himself out of government upon the restoration of Louis XVIII in 1814. Wickedly pragmatic, however, Napoleon’s return presented an opportunity for his own return to power.\r\n\r\nFouché was not driven by idealism but personal gain, being inspired neither by Napoleon nor the Royalists. Within days he both swore his complete loyalty to Napoleon and promised the king’s brother, the comte d’Artois, that he would 'take care of saving the monarchy’. Using his position as head of the police, Fouché played factions off against one another in an attempt to secure his long-term survival. He remained in contact with Metternich throughout the 100 Days and handed military secrets to both Wellington and Bonaparte. Using the wide spy network established during the Napoleonic period, Fouché remained potentially the most well-informed and connected politician of the 100 Days. His role was so established that even Talleyrand, returning from the Congress of Vienna, realised that Fouché was crucial to any government post-Napoleon. He was therefore pardoned by Louis XVIII despite his well-known regicidal leanings and briefly became Prime Minister after Napoleon’s defeat.\r\n",

                "text": "This embroidered white uniform was crafted in 1815 in Vienna for Napoleon’s four-year old son, François Joseph Charles Bonaparte, also known as l’Aiglon (The Eaglet), who emigrated to Austria with his mother, Empress Marie Louise, following his father’s first abdication. Delicately adorned with gold and silver cords, and accompanied by a silk sash and a presentation sword, this uniform encapsulates the conflicting titles the imperial child received in absentia during his father’s attempt to regain power in France between 1814 and 1815.<br /><br />Whilst the Fontainebleau Treaty downgraded François’s title to that of Prince of Parma (instead of King of Rome), the child’s right to the throne was again revised upon his father’s return from Elba. In 22 April 1815, the acte additionnel aux constitutions de l’empire restored his status as imperial prince.<br /><br />The uniform was certainly commissioned after his father’s defeat at Waterloo, when the child was declared Emperor of France in abstention for twenty days between 22 June and 7 July 1815. Whilst this brief regency enabled Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to proclaim himself Emperor Napoleon III in 1851, the recognition of the child was a political mise-en-scène, based on an obsolete constitution and approved by a temporary Executive Commission whose primary intention was to end the imperial regime. In fact, the acts promulgating the child as Emperor did not mention his betrothal as Napoleon II. Placed under the care of his grandfather at Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, the boy was not told much about his father owing to the political division between Austria and France.<br /><br />Napoleon’s summons to Marie Louise during the 100 Days to join him in Paris and to treat the boy as a French prince went unheeded, and he never saw his son again. During Napoleon’s exile on Saint Helena, the child was educated into the Austrian nobility: François became Franz, and in 1818 he was named Duke of Reichstadt. Yet, the early bearing of uniforms did influence the boy’s identity, and led him to develop a fervent passion for soldiering at the age of six, which he later pursued in the Austrian Army.",

He immediately raised the tricolour flag under which he had always marched, and which Louis XVIII had abandoned. He proclaimed himself a ruler legitimised by the people; a son of the Revolution, he had returned to save the French from enslavement to priests and nobles, whom he threatened to ‘string up from the lanterns’. \r\n\r\nHe re-enacted the 1789 abolition of feudalism and tithes, and the 1790 suppression of nobility, and ordered émigrés who had returned with the king to leave the country. Those who had acquired national lands confiscated during the Revolution had their ownership reconfirmed. He allowed the freedom of the press, and in the Acte Additionnel promised representative government and guaranteed civil rights. \r\n\r\nGroups alienated by the Bourbons and their supporters rallied to these gestures, and many formed themselves into ‘Federations’ pledged to back the renewed imperial regime by force. Napoleon was agreeably surprised, but then unnerved, by the strength of social resentment he had unleashed. He did not wish, he said, to owe his throne to a peasant revolt. He preferred the loyalty of soldiers.",

                "text": "In March 1815, a group of wealthy liberal philanthropists established the Société pour l'instruction élémentaire (SIE) [Society for Elementary Instruction] for the purpose of introducing new English methods of elementary mutual teaching into France. \r\n\r\nThe Reverend Andrew Bell in Madras and the layman and dissenter Joseph Lancaster in London had been experimenting independently since the late 18th century with the teaching of large groups of pupils by regularly using the help of the best students. At the beginning of the 19th century, these proposals gained transcontinental popularity and rapidly spread. \r\n\r\nBased on their common work in civic societies, the French group of philanthropists saw in the system of mutual teaching a consistent and economic solution for the rather sluggish pace of development of French elementary education.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the SIE coincided with Napoleon’s return to France. The minister of the interior during the 100 Days, Lazare Carnot (for more on Carnot, see 21 April), strongly supported this initiative, and prepared a decree favouring the propagation of the new techniques. Specifically, an elementary teacher-training school espousing the new method was to be established in Paris. A preparatory commission was created by imperial decree on 27 April 1815, including almost all founding fathers of the SIE and it swiftly designed the new institution. \r\n\r\nDespite these close political ties between the SIE and the 100 Days regime, the SIE survived the political changes of 1815 and became one of the major actors in providing and supporting elementary education well into the 1830s.\r\n",

                "text": "The École Polytechnique was established in Paris in 1794 as the École Centrale des Travaux Publics (Central School of Public Works) to train engineers. In 1804 the school became a military academy and its purpose was to provide the French Empire with military officers. Education was a means through which Napoleon shaped patriotism and loyalism throughout the period. The students at the École Polytechnique, destined for careers in science, business and politics were future leaders and military officers of the French Empire. Napoleon reinforced the school’s aspirations and objectives by giving it the motto, Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire (For the Homeland, Science and Glory).\r\n\r\nHaving taken part in the defence of Paris against the Allies a year earlier, the students of this school would have been loyal followers of Napoleon. Not surprisingly, students of the École Polytechnique in Paris welcomed Napoleon on his return from exile and he made a surprise visit to the school on the 28th April 1815. The Journal de l’Empire’s account of the visit suggests that it was not quite as successful as it might have been as many of the pupils were absent since there were no classes on Wednesday or Friday afternoons. The occasion signals Napoleon’s desperation to restore loyalty and support after initial enthusiasm for his dramatic return had waned. Once again the students were told to defend Paris...\r\n\r\nThe print shows the visit to the École polytechnique on 28th April 1815.\r\n\"Une visite (la seule) de Napoléon le 28 avril 1815 à l’École royale polytechnique /dessiné et gravé par Peronard\r\nParis : Gautier, [vers 1850]\r\nAquatinte ; 46 x 50 cm (61,5 x 66 cm pour toute la feuille)\r\nC1 5\"",

However his support for the King, like that of many in the French army, was doubtful. On the 28th March 1815 Marbot and his regiment, which had been garrisoned in Valenciennes, seized control of the town on Napoleon's orders, and Marbot overturned the authority of General Dubreton, who had remained loyal to Louis XVIII. According to some sources, it was Marbot's action that prevented Dubreton from handing over the town to the British.\r\n\r\nMarbot and his regiment would subsequently join the Waterloo campaign from Valenciennes. They took an active part in the fighting and Marbot was injured whilst charging a British square at Waterloo. On the return of Louis XVIII Marbot was banished from France.\r\n\r\nDespite the high odds of ultimate defeat, the loyalty to Napoleon that Marbot demonstrated was commonplace in the army: earlier glories were ascribed to Napoleon, while the humiliating conditions of peace and the surrender of the Paris defences in March 1814 were associated with the King. After Napoleon’s exile to Elba, officers had been put on half pay and the army was disbanded. Those who remained welcomed Napoleon back. His talent for inspiring his troops was his most important asset in his return to power, and enabled him, when the other European powers refused to recognise his legitimacy, to mobilize an army and to fight the Allied powers one last time in a cautious and war-weary France. \r\n\r\nThis research was completed with funding from the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme.\r\n",

                "text": "While Napoleon did have supporters in German lands, over the years he had caused great suffering to those living there: from the financial burden of occupation and annexation to the conscription of Germans for his campaigns, not to mention the battles fought on German soil. The Wars of Liberation brought together north and south Germans, Catholics and Protestants against a common enemy, and for this reason are often seen as key to the development of pan-German national sentiment.<br /><br />This poster alerts German readers to the escape of Napoleon from Elba, and to his outlaw status, which had been declared mid-March. Along with Napoleon’s titles, the poster details his physical features, using a well-known portrait by Heinrich Anton Dähling from 1806: for a full translation, see ‘Further Information’. It encourages everyone to recapture Napoleon dead or alive: if dead, his embalmed head is to be displayed as a warning.<br /><br />Addressed to ‘die teutsche Nation’ (the German nation), rather than individual kingdoms or states, it echoes the famous ‘Reden an die deutsche Nation’ (‘Addresses to the German Nation’) given by the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte in Berlin in 1807, which called on Germans to unite around their shared history and language, and to emancipate themselves from French occupation. The poster’s attribution to the president of the ‘Tugendbund’ (the ‘League of Virtue’) appears to refer to the secret society of Prussian noblemen formed in 1808, in the wake of Napoleonic defeat and occupation, and banned by 1809 because of its anti-French sentiment. The poster thus seeks to build on pre-existing resentment of Napoleon and earlier pan-German nationalism.",

Since now so very much rests on the capture of this dangerous person, herewith all civil and military personnel are with the greatest urgency requested not only to disseminate this poster as much as possible, but also themselves to seek to seize his person. The president sets down the personal description not only in written form, but also in illustrated form, to enable every brave German man the means to capture this poor sinner, alive or dead – in which latter case, his head should be embalmed, and rented to those touring men who exhibit wild beasts for money, so that he, an object of loathing, may serve as an eternal warning for the Germans and as a deterrent for similar crimes.<br /><br />Personal description: Small of stature, stocky, and of strong bone structure. The face: round, bloated, and all features of justice, compassion and mercy entirely absent. Conversely dark, vacant, bloodthirsty, small black and glittering eyes, a crooked nose, a sneeringly pouting mouth, a thick chin and black and unkempt hair. The skin colour: a pale greenish brown. He is also particularly recognizable in his unsettled manner, in that he one moment rants and raves, the next moment displays a temporary calm, in which he usually assumes the pose given here.<br /><br />He to whom the inexpressible happiness falls to come by this outcast of humanity, this Nic. Bonaparte, he has a fair claim on a third of the certainly rich income from the bounty collected, and such a claim is herewith legally assured to him. The first two thirds of this sum shall be used for the benefit of the unhappy who because of him [Bonaparte] have been crippled, widowed and orphaned. Apart from this however, a more worthy reward will certainly be the sweet, indescribably high feeling of being the dryer of countless tears, the preserver from streams of costly German blood. In the gratitude of saved fathers and sons, in the joyful tears of their women and children, brothers and sisters, his [the captor’s] name will shine on and on. The President of the League of Virtue in Germany",

Diamonds were a potentially valuable cash gift, as it was assumed that they would often be replaced with paste: the fact that the diamonds on this box were not replaced is significant. <br /><br />An engraved gold oval plaque inside this box records how it came to be given to the English sculptor, Mrs Damer: This box was given by the Emperor Napoleon of France to the Honorable Anne Seymour Damer as a ‘souvenir’ (the word he used) in consequence of her having presented him with a bust of Mr. [Charles James] Fox executed in Marble by herself. The bust had been promised at the Peace of Amiens, was finished 1812 and sent to France where it remained but was not presented till May 1st 1815 when by command of His Imperial Majesty Anne Seymour Damer had an audience for that purpose at the Palais Elysée where the Emperor then resided. <br /><br />This was not Mrs Damer’s first meeting with Napoleon. She had met the then Consul and Josephine when she had gone to Paris in 1802 with the chief intention of presenting the Consul with a terracotta bust of Charles James Fox. Joseph Farington recorded in his diary on 11 September of that year that he had seen that bust of Napoleon’s famous British supporter, together with one of Nelson, one of his greatest adversaries, when he had visited the private apartments at the Tuileries. <br /><br />John Cam Hobhouse described Mrs Damer’s second meeting with Napoleon and the presentation of the marble bust of Fox (now at the Château of Malmaison) in his diary on Tuesday 2 May 1815: [I] called on Mrs Damer, who gave an account of an interview she had yesterday with Napoleon. Three years ago she sent a bust of Mr Fox by herself to Paris for the Emperor. The man who brought it got into disgrace – the bust was not delivered.<br /><br /> She comes to Paris just as Napoleon comes, and contrives to find her bust, which is unaltered except that the inscription, Napoleon Empereur et Roi, is scratched out. She contrives to get it presented through Denon – she is at first mistaken for an artist who wants to sell it – the appointment was for the Elysée Napoleon at ten – she goes there, and waits till twelve, when she is shown through a dark passage into a room in which she finds Napoleon standing at a table, on which stood the bust.<br /><br /> The Queen of Holland [Hortense de Beauharnais, Napoleon’s stepdaughter] was standing at a little distance. Napoleon received her very graciously; he said the bust not only showed the face of Mr Fox, but the mind: ‘It was the man’. He praised the original, said had he lived much blood would have been saved. He talked of his own pictures – Mrs Damer told him she had seen none like him. He asked if she had seen Canova's naked statue – she said yes, but did not think it resembling, nor good – ‘You are right,’ he said. <br /><br />He asked her opinion of David – they talked ten minutes – he asked her to what family she belonged – she said the chief of her father and mother's were the Dukes of Argyle and Somerset. This, she said, he contrived to ask to do away the mistake respecting her trade in marble. He asked about the story of the Duke of Bedford – knew his name was Russell. The Queen Hortense spoke not at all. She (Mrs Damer) curtsied backwards out of the room. Napoleon asked her when she came to Paris. She answered, ‘About the same time as your Majesty’. He smiled, and added, ‘N'avez-vous pas peur de moi?’ [Are you not afraid of me?] to which she answered, ‘Non, Sire – les grands hommes n'effrayent pas’ [No, Sire, great men are not frightening], an answer with which he was satisfied … <br /><br />Further reading: Karine Huguenaud, \"The Emperor's Presentation Boxes\", in Napoleon: Revolution to Empire, exhibition catalogue, National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, 2012, pp.202-03. <br /><br />For Hobhouse’s account, see <a href=\"petercochran.files.wordpress.com\">petercochran.files.wordpress.com</a>.",

Rivington: London, 1815)\r\n\r\nBonaparte’s escape from Elba, as for many, caught George Stanley Faber (1773-1854) on the hop. By no means a warrior or politician, Faber was an Anglican clergyman known for his biblical writings. Yet his urgency was understandable: he had just published the latest instalment of his Dissertation on the Prophecies, which mapped Napoleon’s exile against the Book of Revelation. \r\n\r\nMillennialism in this period is often associated with the jeremiads of self-styled prophets like Richard Brothers and the cult leader Joanna Southcott. Yet Faber’s efforts remind us that revolution, regicide, famines and massacres provided portents enough to convince even quite sensible writers in Britain and elsewhere that the End of the World was nigh and Bonaparte the Antichrist. \r\n\r\nBy May Faber had rushed out this corrective, reassuring readers that recent events did not collapse his calculations entirely: the Beast’s demise, he insisted shakily, was certain, even if its manner was presently unclear. By 1818 Faber could safely declare that Bonaparte was not coming back, hailing Wellington as the divinely anointed ‘avenger of long-outraged humanity’. And by then the prophetic consensus had shifted: victory, imperial confidence and missionary growth were convincing Faber and others like him that providence was on Britain’s side.\r\n",

                "text": "On 2-3 May 1815, the battle of Tolentino, fought between the Austrian army and that of the King of Naples Joachim Murat, put an end to Napoleon's domination over Italy. \r\n\r\nIn the days immediately following, the seventeen-year-old philologist and poet Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) wrote an 'oration' in the style of ancient Greek rhetors, praising the defeat of Murat as a first step towards Italian political independence: Agl'italiani. Orazione in occasione della liberazione del Piceno.\r\n\r\nLeopardi's oration can be taken as an eloquent symptom of the multifarious and often ambiguous ways Italian culture portrays and interprets the Napoleonic experience. In particular, Leopardi's focus on illusions, his reiterated stress on the Greco-Roman heritage of Italian culture, and his attempt at revitalizing an ancient ideal of heroism in a post-revolutionary age, testify to a tension between tradition and modernity, which takes the shape of a clashing opposition between Italy - the only legitimate heir of classical culture and values - and France.\r\n\r\nIn Leopardi's words, the Enlightenment dream of 'geometrising all the world', rather than enhancing human happiness, had inaugurated an age of disenchantment that threatened to erode the very grounds of social life. The memory of classical antiquity, as a consequence, was not to be intended as a revivalistic operation, but rather as a fully aware reaction against the triumph of technocracy and cultural relativism. Such tension between antiquity and modernity will pervade Leopardi's later work, and also underlie the ways Italian culture will negotiate and cope with the legacy of the Napoleonic experience in the Bourbon Restoration decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Because of this, after the Third Partition of Poland (1795), he was called by Catherine the Great to the court of Saint Petersburg, to guarantee the Czartoryskis’ loyalty towards Russia. After Alexander I’s accession to the throne, he forged a career in the Russian government. At the forefront of Russian diplomacy in the years 1801-1806, he attempted to persuade Alexander I to restrain Napoleon’s growing hegemony in Europe and to rebuild the Polish state.\r\n\r\nDuring the Congress of Vienna Czartoryski supported the tsar’s efforts to create the Kingdom of Poland with Alexander I as its constitutional ruler. This goal required him both to mitigate the opposition of the many reluctant Russian dignitaries and to moderate the anti-Russian mood of many Poles. During Napoleon’s 100 Days Czartoryski was afraid that the Emperor’s return to power might awaken pro-Napoleonic sympathies among Poles and destroy his previous efforts to create a compromise between them and their future (Russian) king. He published several anonymous letters and articles in the Warsaw newspapers attempting to bring his compatriots to their senses and dissuading them from involvement in a new conflict between Napoleon and the coalition.\r\n",

                "text": "Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (1770-1861), seen here in an 1810 portrait by Józef Oleszkiewicz, was a descendant of a Polish aristocratic family who supported the Polish national cause. In the 1792 war he fought against Russia in defense of Poland’s sovereignty, and after the Third Partition of Poland (1795) he was called by Catherine the Great to the court of Saint Petersburg as a guarantor of the Czartoryskis’ loyalty towards Russia. As a friend of Prince Alexander Pavlovitsch, he was able to make a career in the Russian government after the Prince’s accession to the throne in 1801, belonging to the circle of the so-called ‘young friends of the tsar’ who advised the new ruler on many state matters. \r\n\r\nAt the forefront of Russian diplomacy in years of 1801-1806, Czartoryski attempted to persuade Alexander I to restrain Napoleon’s growing hegemony in Europe and rebuild the Polish state.\r\n\r\nAfter 1806, he moved away from active service but maintained friendly relations with the tsar. Although he was disillusioned with the Russian political system, he nonetheless believed in the liberal intentions of Alexander I, and was convinced that the tsar should use the force of the Russian empire to restore the Polish state. \r\n\r\nDuring the Congress of Vienna Czartoryski supported the tsar’s efforts to create the Kingdom of Poland with Alexander I as its constitutional ruler. This goal required him both to mitigate the opposition of many reluctant Russian dignitaries and to moderate anti-Russian moods of many Poles. During the Napoleon’s 100 Days he was afraid that Emperor’s return to power might awaken pro-Napoleonic sympathies among the Poles and destroy his previous efforts to create a compromise between them and their future (Russian) king. \r\n\r\nHe published several anonymous letters and articles in the Warsaw newspapers attempting to bring his compatriots to their senses and dissuading them from involvement in a new conflict between Napoleon and the coalition. His fear was not unfounded: the Napoleonic legend was still vivid in Poland, and the anti-Russian mood was widespread, especially among many officers and young men. Ultimately, the conviction that the new war would not affect the political situation in the Polish lands prevailed, and no official pro-Napoleonic action was taken, although about 1000 Polish volunteers fought alongside Napoleon in Belgium campaign. \r\n\r\nOn 20 June 1815, two days after the battle of Waterloo, the Kingdom of Poland was officially proclaimed in Warsaw.\r\n",

Historians have suggested that his return was the result of the news of Napoleon’s escape from Elba: well aware of Bonaparte’s reputation, Muhammad Ali wanted to keep an eye on new political developments in Europe.\r\n\r\nMuhammad Ali, a soldier of Albanian origin, had come to power in Egypt after the end of the French occupation there in 1801, succeeding in making himself the de facto ruler under the formal suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan. \r\n\r\nNapoleon, not yet Emperor but a general under the Directory, had invaded Egypt in 1798 at the head of the Armée de l’Orient: French troops remained until forced to retire by the British in 1801. \r\n\r\nA master of propaganda, Bonaparte had issued this proclamation, rendered into Arabic by Syrian Christian translators, on his arrival in Alexandria. In the name of ‘the French Republic built on the foundation of Liberty and Equality’, Bonaparte assures the Egyptians of good intentions towards Egypt and Islam, and urges them to rise up against their Mamluk rulers. The proclamation, and Napoleon himself, have generated interest in the Arab world ever since.\r\n\r\nFor a translation of the proclamation, see ‘Further Information’.\r\n",

                "text": "Bonaparte's proclamation to the people of Egypt, dated Alexandria, 13 Messidor Year VI (1 July 1798)\r\n\r\nContemporary English translation from: Copies of original letters from the army of General Bonaparte in Egypt, intercepted by the fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Nelson. (London, J. Wright, 1798-1800, 3 vols.), vol. 1, pp. 235-237.\r\n\r\nIN the name of God, gracious and merciful.—There is no God but God; he has no son or associate in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe present moment, which is destined for the punishment of the Beys, has been long anxiously expected. The Beys, coming from the mountains of Georgia and Bajars, have desolated this beautiful country, long insulted and treated with contempt the French Nation, and oppressed her merchants in various ways. Bonaparte, the General of the French Republic, according to the principles of Liberty, is now arrived; and the Almighty, the Lord of both Worlds, have sealed the destruction of the Beys.\r\n\r\nInhabitants of Egypt! When the Beys tell you the French are come to destroy your religion, believe them not: it is an absolute falsehood. Answer those deceivers, that they are only come to rescue the rights of the poor from the hands of their tyrants, and that the French adore the Supreme Being, and honour the Prophet and his holy Koran.\r\n\r\nAll men are equal in the eyes of God: understanding, ingenuity, and science, alone make a difference between them: as the Beys, therefore, do not possess any of these qualities, they cannot be worthy to govern the country.\r\n\r\nYet are they the only possessors of extensive tracts of land, beautiful female slaves, excellent horses, magnificent palaces! Have they then received an exclusive privilege from the Almighty? If so, let them produce it. But the Supreme Being, who is just and merciful towards all mankind, wills that in future none of the inhabitants of Egypt shall be prevented from attaining to the first employments and the highest honours.—The Administration, which shall be conducted by persons of intelligence, talents, and foresight, will be productive of the happiness and security. The tyranny and avarice of the Beys have laid waste Egypt, which was formerly so populous and well cultivated. \r\n\r\nThe French are true Mussulmen. Not long since they marched to Rome, and overthrew the Throne of the Pope, who excited the Christians against the professors of Islamism (The Mahometan religion). Afterwards they directed their course to Malta, and drove out the unbelievers, who imagined they were appointed by God to make war on the Mussulmen. The French have at all times been the true and sincere friends of the Ottoman Emperors, and the enemies of their enemies. May the Empire of the Sultan therefore be eternal; but may the Beys of Egypt, our opposers whose insatiable avarice has continually excited disobedience and insubordination, be trodden in the dust, and annihilated!\r\n\r\nOur friendship shall be extended to those of the inhabitants of Egypt who shall join us, as also those who shall remain in their dwellings, and observe a strict neutrality; and when they have seen our conduct with their own eyes, hasten to submit to us; but the dreadful punishment of death awaits those who shall take up arms for the Beys, and against us. For then there shall be no deliverance, nor shall any trace of them remain.\r\n\r\nArt. 1. All places which shall be three leagues distant from the route of the French army, shall send one of their principal inhabitants to the French General, to declare that they submit, and will hoist the French flag, which is blue, white, and red.\r\n\r\nArt. 2. Every village which shall oppose the French army shall be burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nArt. 3. Every village which shall submit to the French, shall hoist the French flag, and that of the Sublime Porte, their Ally, whose duration be eternal.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. The Cheiks and principal persons of each town and village shall seal up the houses and effects of the Beys, and take care that not the smallest article shall be lost.\r\n\r\nArt. 5. The Cheiks, Cadis, and Imans, shall continue to exercise their respective functions; and put up their prayers, and perform the exercise of religious worship in the mosques and houses of prayer. All the inhabitants of Egypt shall offer up thanks to the Supreme Being, and put up public prayers for the destruction of the Beys.\r\n\r\nMay the Supreme God make the glory of the Sultan of the Ottomans eternal, pour forth his wrath on the Mameloucs, and render glorious the destiny of the Egyptian Nation.\r\n\r\n",

Here, a judge named Kleemann from the Saxonian town of Cönnern is being placed under investigation for supposed Francophilia (Franzosenfreundlichkeit) after associating with French prisoners of war. \r\n\r\nWhile the unnamed writer acknowledges that the evidence is extremely flimsy, he proposes that the judge, who was known to be of a liberal political persuasion, should be replaced anyway. This pattern was repeated numerous times in what would subsequently become the Province of Saxony, and doubtless elsewhere too. Grounds for being charged with Franzosenfreundlichkeit included collaboration during the French occupation, sympathies with revolutionary ideology or, as in this case, mere contact with prisoners of war. \r\n\r\nThese investigations might be seen as evidence of Prussian officials’ concern at Napoleon’s return; equally, his return may simply have provided them with an opportunity to dispose of politically suspect public servants. \r\n\r\nThis research was completed with funding from the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme.\r\n",

                "text": "When he returned to power in 1815, Napoleon made some liberal concessions in the Acte additionnel (see entry for 22 April). Like previous constitutional changes, it was submitted to a plebiscite. All adult males were invited to sign registers, opened in their communities for several days at the end of April. \r\n\r\nThis was a public vote, so participants were invited to add their names, or have them written for them if they were illiterate, under two columns, yes and no. Few negative votes were cast – a mere 5,000, as opposed to 1.3 million yes votes, on a 20% turnout – but some 10,000 voters expressed an opinion, justifying or qualifying their verdicts.\r\n\r\nThe register from Montmirail, a village of 2,000 inhabitants in north-eastern France offers a fine example. An individual named Bailly amplified a negative vote at considerable length. His major objection, widely shared, concerned the establishment of a hereditary chamber of peers. Other annotations, entered elsewhere, questioned the extent of Napoleon’s authority and demanded greater power for an elected legislative assembly. By contrast, some supporters felt he was yielding too much authority, while royalists rejected the entire proposal. \r\n\r\nThese comments reflect hidden opposition to Napoleon’s attempt to reinvent himself as a people’s emperor during the 100 Days.\r\n",

                "text": "The ‘Journal’ of Charles Weiss (1779-1866), Besançon’s librarian, chronicles the effect of Napoleon’s return to power on the town, from the first rumours that Napoleon had landed (news reaches them on 8 March) to the report of Louis XVIII’s entry into Paris in July. Besançon is a key strategic location in the east of France and rumours that the Austrians were about to invade circulated from as early as the end of March, made more credible by orders on 5 April to start stockpiling for a siege. Troops were moved in and out of the town constantly, often on their way to Belfort. As a result, the town experiences the changes in power in a very direct and tangible way.\r\n\r\nWeiss’s diary also serves as a reminder that the political events of the 100 days have an impact on the daily lives of ordinary individuals in the French provinces. His entries reveal Besançon to be a town split between opposing factions, where rumours are rife and the authorities struggling to keep the peace. In mid-March the authorities have a coach driver arrested for bringing in newspapers from Lyon; by the end of the month, Bonapartists are breaking the windows of shops belonging to royalists. By May, those known to have royalist sympathies are being kept under surveillance... and by June curfews are in place as the only way of preventing disturbances. \r\n\r\nIn the entry Weiss writes for today, 8th May 1815, he reports how an imperial decree has formally placed the town in a state of siege. The residents are advised to stockpile sufficient provisions for 6 months. Rumours are that ‘the enemy’ has already reached Strasbourg and that the Swiss are about to cross into Franche-Comté. Despite the apparent severity of the situation, Weiss notes the complete lack of enthusiasm shown by the inhabitants called up to form a national guard, much to the displeasure of the General Saint-Clair sent to review them. When they due to depart two days later, over half are missing... Only one resident formally rejects the acte additionnel when it is put to plebiscite but that does not mean that the inhabitants of Besançon are wholeheartedly behind the Emperor's miliary endeavours. Far from it in fact....",

                "text": "On 25 April 1815, whilst visiting Paris on diplomatic duties, the American politician John Quincy Adams attended ‘the Spectacle Instructif and Phantasmagoria of Robertson on the boulevards’. There, he saw various optical illusions and automata, through which he had a glimpse into the state of the arts and sciences in post-Napoleonic France. But, for him and for other American observers, the whole city of Paris became an ‘instructive spectacle’ of political turmoil during the 100 Days.\r\n\r\nIn his diary, he noted how witnessing Parisian reactions to Napoleon’s return informed and altered his vision of political legitimacy and liberalism. His initial admiration for the Emperor and the popular fervour he observed in theatres faded away in May when, after witnessing the exodus of English travellers, he decided to visit the Marquis de Lafayette in his sheltered Château de la Grange in Seine-et-Marne. For a week, they discussed the events at a distance from the central stage of the capital, through the collective reading of newspapers.\r\n\r\n‘The General gave [him] the last number of the Censeur – a periodical work, edited by two young lawyers, who after having been in violent opposition to the Bourbons, [were] now equally opposed to Napoleon’. Whilst the newspaper echoed the views of Lafayette, these readings were subject to debate in the marquis’ private library. \r\n\r\nMarie-Charles-César de Faÿ joined them in commenting on Benjamin Constant’s pamphlets and, after conversing on the essence of liberalism, they agreed that the current situation in France, and the opinions expressed by the Censeur, were testament to the fact that ‘Quiddism [was] not exclusively the growth of the American soil’. \r\n\r\nThe movement ‘Tertium Quids’, or ‘third something’, had emerged in America in 1806 as a third political way between Federalists and Republicans. For Adams, a third way, between Louis XVIII and Napoleon, needed to be pursued in May 1815 to restore liberty, peace and unity in France. \r\n\r\nOverall, Adams’s diary tells us something about the importance of print culture and polite conversations in the ways in which foreign diplomats interpreted the French political upheaval of 1815.",

                "text": "The revolutionary origins of the 'Marseillaise' are well known. Originally the ‘War Song of the Army of the Rhine’, it was written in 1792 by a constitutional monarchist in Strasbourg, Rouget de Lisle, to inspire troops to protect France against its enemies. Quickly adopted and adapted by the French, it soon acquired an association not just with war, but with the popular sovereignty of the French Revolution in general – and with the fall of the monarchy in particular. This is what made it so popular across Europe for much of the nineteenth century, but also what made Napoleon consider it dangerous during his increasingly autocratic rule: the song was dropped from the official song list under the Empire.\r\n\r\nNapoleon returned in 1815 on a wave of popular support, with François-René Chateaubriand reporting that 'the people are singing La Marseillaise, and the red caps are back: they are putting them on busts of Napoleon … The Revolution is coming back to life'. Once in power, Napoleon attempted to harness this sentiment by emphasizing his own revolutionary credentials, and he tolerated the organisations of neo-revolutionary fédérés that sprang up, even if he refused to arm them [see 14 May]. \r\n\r\nOne such group, in the Rhone valley, used the tune of the 'Marseillaise' for their ‘La Fédération’, sung at a meeting on 16 May (for a translation and recording, see ‘Further Information’). But the day after Napoleon’s the acte additionnel was ratified at the Champ de Mai (1 June), Napoleon had the Marseillaise deleted from the official song list, again mistrustful of the very 'people power' that had reinstated him as head of France. \r\n",

                "text": "Censorship was a sensitive matter in 1815. Although it was supposedly abolished on 24th March by Napoleon, this censorship report for a historical drama entitled Le Triomphe de Léon proves the contrary. \r\n\r\nThe young author of this play, intended for performance in Toulouse, had transposed the contemporary political situation onto the stage, with the parallels clearly intended to be enjoyed: Louis XVIII became Clovis, the Duke of Berry became the Duke of Cantorbury, and Marshal Soult was ‘disguised’ as Zoult. \r\n\r\nThe play was first banned at departmental level; this report renders the prohibition national. However, the playwright had still gone so far as to write the drama and to submit it to the authorities. He evidently believed there was the potential to perform it in Toulouse, far from Paris, which in turn questions Napoleon’s control of France during this turbulent period.\r\n\r\nThis report (translated in ‘Further Information’) also reveals how contemporaries perceived the events of the 100 Days. The official censors refer to this period as the ‘new Revolution’, which has been decided upon by a conveniently abstract ‘France’. The actual role of the people in this ‘France’ is small: the censors decide that such big political questions cannot be decided by the rowdy masses of the theatre pit.\r\n",

Knowing how inconvenient this masquerade is and how it is absurd to put these weighty political questions which France has just decided to the parterre, the extraordinary commissioner on mission in the department has provisionally forbidden the performance of this drama.

They issued a new protocol on 12 May 1815, reaffirming their opposition to Napoleon, denying him any legitimacy and insisting that the French people had lost the right to decide their own form of government. They justified this hard-line stance on the grounds of stability – with Napoleon as head of state, ‘a new explosion’, as they put it, would be inevitable and Europe could not enjoy peace and prosperity without removing him from power.\r\n\r\nThe plenipotentiaries who signed the almost daily protocols were supported by a host of secretaries. Gibbs Crawfurd Antrobus (1793-1861) was a junior British attaché at the Congress of Vienna from late 1814 until August 1815. This is believed to be the carriage he used whilst undertaking his diplomatic responsibilities there. It is one of the oldest in the National Trust Carriage Museum at Arlington Court. The carriage could seat two and included a compartment at the back for Antrobus’s sword. It could be pulled by post horses for long journeys but then converted to town use for a coachman to drive.\r\n\r\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, Antrobus was appointed Secretary of Legation to the United States and became an MP in 1821.\r\n",

Published anonymously in May 1815, we have no record of its performance, though it may have been put on in one on Paris's private singing societies, where writers would try out new material.\r\n\r\nCadet Buteux is a character who appears in a number of vaudevilles from this period; generally an 'everyman', his songs here are written in an approximation of colloquial French. He was often used to give a satirical and cynical take on current affairs, and this vaudeville has him deciding to run the country himself. While outlining his constitution, Cadet Buteux mocks the idea that new constitutions are ever different from old ones. His own plan is for two chambers in government: one of representatives, the other of people prepared to turn a blind eye, with his friends as ministers. His new constitution will be put to the people of France to ratify, but he predicts their apathy, and will in any case guarantee their approval with soldiers if necessary. \r\n\r\nThe text expresses the powerlessness of ordinary individuals subjected to regime change, and mocks the revisions to the constitution proposed by Napoleon in May 1815: it's easy to see why it wasn't performed in public....\r\n\r\nFor translations and recordings of four extracts from the vaudeville, see 'Further Information'.\r\n",

For a long while, every one’s been getting in a tizzy, <br />To hook a job, <br />To sort out politics <br />And to make laws. <br />I, who have ambition, <br />Skill and audacity,<br /> I am going to knock up a constitution; <br />Maybe it will make up the nation’s mind <br />To give me a good position. <br /><br />20.

If I ask for approval <br />From all the inhabitants of France <br />On this new Constitution, <br />It’s just for show, ‘cause I’ll find, I think, <br />No more Normans, no more Gascons <br />Who will want to say either yes or no. <br /><br />21.

                "text": "On Sunday, 14 May 1815, in the Place du Carousel outside the Tuileries Palace, Napoleon reviewed twelve thousand men from Paris’s working-class districts who had banded together as a volunteer militia of fédérés (federates). In their address to Napoleon, they hailed him as “the representative of the nation, [and] the defender of the Fatherland,” adding that “you consecrate forever the rights of the people; you will reign by the Constitution and the laws. We come to offer our arms, our courage and our blood for the safety of the capital”.\r\n\r\nThe semi-official print of the review (the black and white print below left) depicted these fédérés as respectable workingmen, but this contemporary caricature of the scene lampooned them as the dregs of society. The contrasting images highlight a social, political and ideological contradiction at the heart of the 100 Days. On returning from Elba, Napoleon sought to win over the masses by reclaiming the heritage of the French Revolution. The enthusiastic response he elicited alarmed many, including Napoleon himself, who refused to arm the fédérés. As Antoine-Claire Thibaudeau explained in his memoirs, “they were considered a revolutionary army, and terrified the upper classes and the monarchical government. It was said that they reeked of the Republic”.\r\n",

                "text": "The writer François-René de Chateaubriand had initially supported Napoleon Bonaparte but he became much more critical once Napoleon crowned himself Emperor. By 1814 Chateaubriand held an openly hostile position. He published a scathing essay De Buonaparte et des Bourbons in 1814, attacking the Emperor for being a tyrant, the destroyer of France, a mad man. \r\n\r\nIn exile in Ghent with King Louis XVIII during the 100 days, Chateaubriand returned to the emotive vocabulary and rhetoric of De Buonaparte et des Bourbons when he published a Rapport sur l'état de la France, fait au roi dans son Conseil in the royalist newspaper the Moniteur de Gand. The report appeared in the newspaper on 12th May and was also published separately as a political brochure. \r\n\r\nThe report on the state of the country is a curious mix of rhetoric and astute observation. Napoleon is systematically denounced as a usurper, a tyrant, a charlatan, the enemy of mankind who has created a regime of Terror and war but Chateaubriand correctly identifies fundamental flaws in the new political structure that he believes will bring about the Emperor’s downfall. He comments on the fact that by calling up the National Guard, Napoleon is reintroducing conscription by the backdoor and that the gaps in its ranks prove that the people of France are not unanimously behind the new regime (see the entry for 8th May on gaps in the National Guard ranks in Besançon for instance). Chateaubriand is convinced that France has recovered from the surprise of Napoleon’s return, that support is on the wane, and that the west is just waiting for the right signal to rebel (insurrection will in fact start in the Vendée today, 15 May 1815).The acte additionnel will, he feels, be the Emperor’s undoing. \r\n\r\nIn retrospect, of course, many of Chateaubriand’s pronouncements are proved true but the question of whether or not the ruler of destiny had become fortune’s fool continues to provoke debate today.\r\n",

                "text": "On 30 April, Napoleon took the surprising and unprecedented step of calling on all male citizens in villages and towns of under 5000 to elect their mayors and adjoints (deputies). This risked not only disrupting war preparations but also seeing numerous communes falling into royalist hands.\r\n\r\nOver the coming weeks, tens of thousands of communal electoral assemblies met, elected their officials and drew up minutes of their proceedings, like the one shown here for the electoral assembly at Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Taille, held on 16 May 1815. Unlike in subsequent municipal elections, in the fraught circumstances of the 100 Days, departmental officials did not have time to collate results and pass them up the line. Consequently, how citizens responded to this short-lived experiment in village democracy can only be discovered through the intensive study of these documents − and until now no such study had been undertaken for any part of France.\r\n\r\nThis has not prevented historians from seeing the elections as a humiliating setback for Napoleon, resulting in the confirmation in office of men overwhelmingly hostile to his restored regime. Perhaps, though, holding the elections, which, according to one contemporary was ‘the only popular thing Bonaparte did on his return’ (Mémoires de Madame de Chastenay, vol. 2, (Paris, 1896), p. 514), helped secure his ‘posthumous’ reputation as a ‘man of the people’.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the elections at Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Taille, as given by the minutes shown, see 'Further Information'.\r\n",

                "text": "Saint-Nicolas-de-la-Taille is a commune in the arrondissement of Le Havre in the Norman department of the Seine-Maritime (then Seine-Inférieure). At the time of the 1806 census it had 879 inhabitants. During the 100 Days, its electoral assembly was convoked by the municipal council, in accordance with the decree of 30 April 1815, and met on Tuesday 16 May 1815 in the town hall (not in the parish church, as was more often the case). The minutes, which consist of two folio sheets, are written in a regular hand and give quite a full and articulate account of the assembly’s operations.\r\n\r\nAs delegated by the council, Jean Manoury opened proceedings by explaining the purpose of the assembly and reading aloud the regulations it was to follow, including the famous municipal law of 14 December 1789, which was (partially) resurrected for the occasion.\r\nFive ballots were held: the first two to choose the assembly’s president and secretary and the three tellers (between them forming the ‘bureau’); the third and fourth to elect the mayor and his deputy respectively; and the fifth to elect its full complement of ten municipal councillors. This last ballot was in fact in contravention of the decree of 30 April, which envisaged only the election of mayors and adjoints. It is tempting to see this as a bid to seize fuller communal autonomy than Napoleon was willing to concede, but it is more likely that the extra ballot arose as a result of the assembly mistakenly following provisions of the Revolution’s municipal law which government had intended should not apply.\r\n\r\nUnusually, the assembly grew considerably in the course of its proceedings: 19 votes were cast in the first ballot whereas 46 voters took part in the ballot for mayor and 59 in the ballot for adjoint. By our reckoning, a third of the adult population took part in this latter ballot, which is just above the average turnout rate for the department. (All male resident aged 21 or over, except for hired servants, were entitled to vote.)\r\n\r\nAs in the majority of communes in the department, the incumbent mayor (Louis Thomas) and the adjoint (François Baudouin) were re-elected, although in the mayor’s case with a lower than average vote share: (70 per cent against 85 per cent for a sample of 152 of the department’s communes). \r\n\r\nAnother way in which this assembly differed from those in neighbouring communes was that the minutes specify that the whole assembly took the oath of ‘obedience to the Constitutions of the Empire and loyalty to the Emperor’. However, this should not be taken to mean that the commune was a Bonapartist stronghold: like many in the area, it returned the register of votes on the plebiscite on the Acte Additionnel without a single resident having recorded a vote.\r\n\r\nShortly after his election, the mayor was suspended and replaced by ‘a rich protestant’ after being the object of an anonymous denunciation. It was said he protected deserters from the army and his son openly paraded his royalist sympathies by wearing the white cockade of the Bourbons. Not surprisingly, Thomas senior was re-instated as mayor on Louis XVIII’s return and with Baudouin was still in office on the eve of the Revolution of 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Reading:\r\n\r\nJohn Dunne, ‘In search of the village and small-town elections of Napoleon’s Hundred Days: a departmental case study’, French History, forthcoming).\r\n",

                "text": "In the middle of May 1815, Parisians were gripped not by the legislative elections or by the preparations for war but by a murder trial. Antoine Serres de Saint-Clair faced a retrial in front of a military tribunal for murdering the prostitute Cornelia Kersemacker, known as ‘La Belle Hollandaise’, in November 1814. It was the theatre critic, Martainville, who regaled the readers of the Journal de Paris with details day by day as the trial proceeded but it was also covered at length in the Journal de l’Empire and the Quotidienne. The conclusion of the trial was dramatic. When, on 18th May, Saint-Clair was found guilty, accused of dishonouring the military profession, and stripped of his Légion d’honneur, he pulled a dagger out and stabbed himself, declaring he had never made an attempt on anyone’s life. Mortally wounded, he was carried back to prison but his actions would live on in fiction.\r\nThe murder forms part of the backdrop to one of the most significant literary productions of the 19th century: Balzac’s ‘Comédie humaine’, a series of novels published in the 1830s and 1840s where characters recur from text to text. Balzac appropriates the murder of ‘la belle Hollandaise’ as part of the backstory of the prostitute Esther Gobseck, who reappears a number of times in the series. Her mother, Sarah, nicknamed ‘la belle hollandaise, also a prostitute, was murdered by a captain when Esther was a child. The name of the victim has been changed by Balzac but there is no mistaking the origin of the fictional event.\r\n",

                "text": "As secretary to Baron vom Stein (a Prussian statesman at the head of reform and war efforts), Ernst Moritz Arndt was able to avoid serious censorship and make the most of communication networks facilitating publication on a grand scale: during the period 1812-1815, he would become one of the most popular German writers and poets. \r\n\r\nIn addition to essays, songs and pamphlets, he wrote this very successful catechism for German soldiers, a fourth version of which was published during the 100 Days in Cologne, with an introduction dated 18 May 1815.\r\n\r\nFor this edition, Arndt added a new introduction that presented Napoleon as evil personified and King Louis XVIII as wise and mild, a victim of injustice. The French army, he argued, was now accustomed to all kind of violence, rape, plunder, and should not be treated with pity. Arndt therefore encouraged all German people to take up arms against the enemy for a holy and sacred war. \r\n\r\nUsing binary divisions between Good/Bad, Holy/ungodly, German/French, Arndt assured his readers that God would not again abandon the German people, who are more courageous and more Christian the French. Read in the light of this new introduction, the catechism thus becomes a manual describing how soldiers must behave in response to the trial God places before them – as Germans, as Christians, and as human beings – and puts military service within the framework of religious and moral patriotic duty.\r\n\r\nFor more on Stein, Arndt, and nationalistic, anti-French propaganda, see 'Further Information'.\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein (commonly known as Baron vom Stein) was a Prussian statesman responsible for introducing several reforms later essential for the unification of Germany. Very critical towards Napoleon during the French occupation of Prussia, he was obliged to resign in 1808, but was then summoned to the Russian Empire by Tsar Alexander I in 1812. There he decided to stage a rearguard attack on Napoleon. \r\n\r\nAs a fervent nationalist, Stein hoped to liberate his fatherland and awaken the patriotism of his compatriots, the patriotism not just of the bourgeoisie, intellectuals and nobles, but also of Napoleon's troops, and of country dwellers. Until then, the working classes had generally been excluded from nationalist messages; Stein however hoped to make the German 'people' aware of their right and duty to unity and independence. To that effect he decided to make use of the talents of Ernst Moritz Arndt – a popular figure in literary circles and, since the publication of ‘Geist der Zeit’, much appreciated for his nationalist and anti-French texts. Arndt was therefore summoned to Russia, where he would remain for over 18 months as the Baron's secretary. \r\n\r\nAt the end of October 1812, the propagandist wrote and published an anonymous pamphlet: Kurzer Katechismus für deutsche Soldaten. It was composed of 15 chapters (each about two pages long) and addressed explicitly to the deutsche Legion, which would later become known as the Russian-German Legion (created in Russia with German deserters or prisoners of war who could be induced to fight against Napoleon). \r\n\r\nA second version of the catechism, written by Arndt in early 1813 in Königsberg, was circulated by Stein principally at his own expense. This time, the author addressed the soldiers of the regular army, and in particular the Landwehr, which, was under the command of Stein himself. 10,000-15,000 copies of the catechism were financed and distributed in early February 1813, and a similar number in July, during the truce negotiated for the troops from Silesia and Saxony. Stein delegated responsibility for the distribution of the text to his General friends and other military officials. This catalogue of ethical norms for inexperienced soldiers was therefore extremely successful, with 20-30,000 copies distributed throughout Germany. Even though it is always difficult to study the reception of this type of text, it is plausible that Arndt's catechism reached not only Northern Prussia and the Mitteldeutschland, but also the Rhine countries and the allied armies. In any case, it was read or heard by most of the common soldiers in the Landwehr. \r\n\r\nBut Arndt soon became disappointed by the political developments in his country. Before long, the republication of his catechism was refused and he was asked to show a little more respect for royalty (including Napoleon). In the liberating armies the tide had turned against Arndt’s revolutionary spirit. Arndt reworked his catechism and published a new version in August 1813 in Silesia under the title Katechismus für den deutschen Kriegs- und Wehrmann, worin gelehrt wird, wie ein christlicher Wehrmann sein und mit Gott in den Streit gehen soll. In this third catechism, Arndt's language was much more measured; the introduction and the 'dissident' chapters were replaced by a long prologue providing a relatively precise overview of the historical situation and several new chapters. It became an account of Christian ethics for all soldiers. This catechism was extremely successful, with no less than ten editions and a total of 60-80,000 copies published, on top of numerous commentaries, announcements and reviews in different journals (See Schäfer and Hagemann in the bibliography below for details). \r\n\r\nA fourth version of the catechism, slightly different to the third but under the same title, was published during the 100 Days, and this is the one which is presented here, published in Cologne with a new introduction dated 18th May 1815. In this new introduction, Arndt presented Napoleon as evil personified and King Louis XVIII as wise and mild, a victim of injustice. The French army that followed the Emperor, he argued, was now accustomed to all kinds of violence, rape, plunder, and should not be treated with pity. Arndt therefore encouraged all German people to take up arms against the enemy for a holy and sacred war. Using binary divisions between Good/Bad, Holy/ungodly, German/French, Arndt assured his readers that God would not again abandon the German people, who are more courageous and more Christian than the French. \r\n\r\nRead in the light of this new introduction, the catechism thus becomes a manual describing how soldiers must behave in response to the trial God places before them – as Germans, as Christians, and as human beings – and puts military service within the framework of religious and moral patriotic duty.It is not surprising that, over the two centuries that followed the Napoleonic era, Arndt's catechism was reedited on numerous occasions in support of the Franco-German Erbfeindschaft (hereditary hate):\r\nThe catechisms of Ernst Moritz Arndt were republished in 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1924, 1930, 1937, 1939, 1941 and 1942, dates which call for reflection…\r\n\r\nIn 1934, Georg Schübel, the author of several school textbooks including some which are part of the 'auszusondernden Literatur', wrote the introduction for a republication Arndt's catechism (as well as another anti-napoleonic catechism of that period, by Heinrich von Kleist) presenting him as 'Vorkämpfer für deutsche Art, Freiheit und Größe' (precursor fighter for German customs, liberty and greatness).\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\nHAGEMANN, Karen: ‘Mannlicher Muth und Teutsche Ehre’: Nation, Militär und Geschlecht zur Zeit der Antinapoleonischen Kriege Preußens, Schöningh, Paderborn, 2002, p. 29.\r\nHAGEMANN, Karen: « Federkriege.

                "text": "On 29 March 1815, Nikolai Turgenev (1789-1871), a key figure of Russian liberal thought, wrote in his diary: 'Today [we] found out here that N[apoleon] entered into Paris as if he was back from a journey. He plays his role in a masterly fashion among a people made up of actors. What is going to happen? What influence will this coup have on Russia?'\r\n\r\nIn 1813, the Prussian statesman Baron vom Stein had requested that Turgenev, a young civil servant who had studied in Moscow and in Göttingen, join his department and act as his personal secretary. This appointment carried the young man into the heart of European diplomacy, and in late September 1814 he arrived in Vienna to attend the Congress as part of the Russian delegation. It was there that the news about Napoleon's escape from Elba reached him on 7 March 1815; confined to his room for many weeks after a long sickness, Turgenev dedicated his free time to reading and to his diary.\r\n\r\nNapoleon appears in this diary only a few times between early March and early July 1815. Initially his escape does not strike Turgenev as having serious consequences, and the young man is surprised to see the French residents in Vienna worrying; in his view, Napoleon is rootless, a man without fatherland and hence any real perspective. As Napoleon's landing progresses, the Russian diplomat declares the French responsible for the success of the absurd endeavour, thus earning them 'the contempt of other nations' (19 March). \r\n\r\nThe theatrical metaphor he uses to write about the Parisian entrée of Napoleon on 29 March binds together the French philosopher Denis Diderot's idea of acting (where the actor preserves a distance between their real self and dramatic fiction) and the crisis of national sovereignty in France, which would later be expressed in the external government of the French territories: Lorraine, for example, found itself under the supervision of the Russian Empire, and Turgenev served as the assistant to the military governor of the province, David Alopaeus, until the end of the 100 Days.\r\n",

                "text": "'Le Censeur des censeurs ou Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de la révolution du 20 mars' was a weekly newspaper which benefited from the short moment of (supposed) freedom of press during the 100 Days: Napoleon had abolished censorship in March. Its publication life was brief – the first issue appeared on 6th May 1815 and it was replaced by the Journal du lys et Bulletin des chambres in September 1815 – but it offers an insight into how royalist material was published in France during the 100 days.\r\n\r\nReaders today will be struck by the title: Napoleon’s return to Paris was presented as another revolution. Equally striking is how the articles uncover and foreground the transmission of news: the issue of 20th May, for example, uses a royalist newspaper from Ghent to relate the events of 14th April; an account of the events of the 10th May, meanwhile, has been transmitted via London. \r\n\r\nThe periodical’s use of other newspapers as sources thus enabled it to convey multiple views of contemporary events that deviated from those of Napoleon’s government – albeit with cautious curatorial footnotes so as not to fall foul of the authorities: here, for example, a footnote clarifies that Napoleon’s name is not synonymous with ‘crimes’ but rather with ‘gloire’. The stratagem of appearing to support the Emperor through footnotes did not fool the Marquis de Lafayette and John Adams as we have seen (entry for 9th May). Although the periodical does not express a view entirely in line with that of Napoleon's returned government, its existence was tolerated and MODERATELY controlled via censorship, as the final printed and bound volume of 1816 reveals by including the cuts of the censor. \r\n",

The Vendée residents had warmly welcomed the return of Louis XVIII, and were deceived by the latter’s moderation vis-à-vis the imperial heritage: they called him the “roi Pataut”, or the republican king. \r\n\r\nThe rebels therefore tried to form a second front in the Vendée in order to immobilise as many imperial troupes as possible. However, owing to jealousy and rivalries, the people of the Vendée were not able to raise the 50,000 men they had foreseen; they were 14,000 in total, badly armed, and without munitions. On the 28th May, Lamarque arrived in Angers to subdue the rebellion, replacing the rather aged General Deaborde. However, he departed from Napoleon's order to break the bells, to take hostages, to assassinate the leaders and to seize their possessions. Lamarque preferred a more patriotic tone, as indicated by his declaration: ‘I do not blush to ask you for peace, because in civil wars, there is no other glory than to end them.’\r\n\r\nFor more on Lamarque in Angers, see Further Information for the original article in French.\r\n",

                "text": "28 MAI 1815 : ARRIVÉE DU GÉNÉRAL LAMARQUE À ANGERS\r\nIllustration : Habit du général de division de Maximien Lamarque (petite tenue). Toile brodée de fils d'argent (les boutons ont été changés sous la Restauration). Vraisemblablement l'uniforme qu'il porta en Vendée. [Musée d'Art et d'Histoire de Cholet. Photo de l'auteur].\r\n\r\nAvant la Vendée, Maximien Lamarque (1770-1832) a souvent combattu dans « des guerres sans gloire », à savoir dans le royaume de Naples (1806-1809 et 1810) et en Catalogne (1811-1814). Devenu un spécialiste de la contre-guérilla, son grand fait d'arme reste néanmoins la prise de Capri (4-17 octobre 1808) où capitula un certain Hudson Lowe, colonel des Corsican Rangers et futur geôlier de Napoléon à Sainte-Hélène. \r\nMis en disponibilité sous la Restauration, Lamarque se rallie avec enthousiasme au retour de Napoléon. Celui-ci l'emploie le 24 mars à l'armée du Nord qui doit se préparer à entrer en Belgique. Le 25 mai, le ministre de la Guerre, le maréchal Davout, lui apprend que, sur les conseils de son frère Joseph (ex-roi de Naples et sous lequel il servit comme chef d'état-major), l'Empereur l'a nommé commandant en chef de l'armée de la Loire avec les pleins pouvoirs sur les départements de l'ouest entrés en rébellion le 15 mai. Il a été choisi pour ses talents, sa modération et sa pacification des Calabres. Bon choix assurément : Lamarque est un fidèle de Napoléon, plein d'ardeur, consciencieux, ferme mais humain, habile à parler, à écrire et à négocier. Il accepte de mauvaise grâce ce commandement car il se faisait une joie de combattre sous les yeux de l'Empereur, une rareté dans sa carrière. Au lieu de ça, Lamarque se retrouve à nouveau sur un théâtre d'opération secondaire, une nouvelle fois face à une insurrection populaire et une nouvelle fois confronté à des bandes armées. \r\nDans l'ouest, à l'appel du tocsin du 15 mai, les paysans vendéens se sont rassemblés, de gré ou de force, pour former les différents corps de l'armée royaliste. Ces derniers ne prirent pas les armes avec la même ferveur qu'en 1793. S'ils accueillirent avec chaleur le retour de Louis XVIII, ils furent déçu de sa modération vis-à-vis de l'héritage impérial, au point qu'ils l'appelèrent le « roi Pataut » (le roi républicain). De plus, l'argument religieux ne tient plus puisque Napoléon a relevé les autels et a suspendu également la conscription dans l'ouest. Cette désaffection se concrétise lors des rassemblements : les chefs vendéens se sont targués de pouvoir lever 50.000 hommes, ils sont tout au plus 14.000 mal armés et presque sans munition. D'autre part, ces chefs vendéens ne sont plus les mêmes qu'en 1793. On ne retrouve que les seconds couteaux des précédentes guerres, malgré des noms illustres : les jeunes frères de Henri de La Rochejaquelein, le neveu de Charette, Suzannet, d'Autichamp, Sapinaud. Mais les querelles et les jalousies entre les chefs vendéens vont gangrener la bonne marche de leurs opérations. \r\nC'est le 28 mai que le général Lamarque arrive à Angers, remplaçant le vieux général Delaborde, malade et quelque peu dépassé par les événements. De là, il va s'employer à résorber le soulèvement vendéens avec une extrême modération. Il enfreint alors sciemment les ordres terribles recommandés par Napoléon : briser les cloches, prendre des otages, fusiller les chefs, mise sous séquestre de leurs biens, etc... Il va préférer mener cette guerre à sa manière, avec tact et persuasion. Patriote, il n'oublie pas qu'en face de lui se trouve d'autres Français. Cette proclamation envoyée aux chefs vendéens donne le ton : « Je ne rougis pas de vous demander la paix, car, dans les guerres civiles, il n'y a pas d'autre gloire que de les terminer ».\r\nEn attendant une réponse à ses ouvertures de paix, il ne reste pas inactif : il ne peut compter que sur 7.600 hommes de valeurs très diverses, qu'il va falloir réorganiser, les meilleures et la majorité des troupes étant réservées pour l'armée du Nord. Par contre, il peut compter sur l'aide précieuse du général Travot, vétéran des guerres de Vendée et prolixe en conseils. Celui-ci opère déjà avec sa colonne mobile en harcelant les Vendéens qui attendent des livraisons d'armes d'Angleterre à Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie. Le 19 mai, il a déjà dispersé à Aiguillon un convoi d'armes et le 20 mai, il écrase ces mêmes Vendéens à Aizenay où il libère tous les prisonniers munis de proclamations à répandre dans le pays. Aizenay met ainsi un terme à l'offensive vendéenne et à son effet de surprise, car les (maigres) renforts impériaux arrivent. \r\nLorsque Lamarque arrive à Angers le 28 mai, il pense que tout se dénouerait sans combattre. En effet, le ministre de la Police Fouché a chargé la mission Malartic (composée de royalistes voulant la paix) d'entamer des négociations avec les insurgés pour éviter un affrontement généralisé et la création d'un nouveau front. Ces négociations sont refusées par le « généralissime » Louis de La Rochejaquelein. Mais celui-ci trouve la mort le 2 juin au combat des Mathes (à Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez), décapitant momentanément le mouvement insurrectionnel. Son successeur Sapinaud choisit de continuer le combat. \r\nAvant d'entrer en campagne et suivant les instructions, Lamarque va prendre soin d'isoler les Vendéens, jugés les plus dangereux, des Chouans et des autres insurgés, en coupant toutes les communications des deux côtés de la Loire : il fortifie Nantes, Angers, Saumur, afin de circoncire l'insurrection. Prônant une sévère discipline à ses soldats, il entre en campagne le 10 juin malgré un temps exécrable...\r\n",

These are two letters of the viceroy of Peru, José Fernando de Abascal, Marquis de la Concordia, to the Secretary of Indies in Madrid, Miguel de Lardizábal y Uribe dispatched from Lima on 12 October 1815.  \r\nThe text in the first image acknowledges receipt of a Royal Order (22 May 1815) to imprison envoys allegedly dispatched to America ‘by Joseph Bonaparte to assist in his usurpation’. Joseph Bonaparte had been usurper King of Spain for four years; now it was rumoured that he was to seize Spanish America. It is not clear, however, if such scheme ever existed. The text in the second image reads: ‘Having learned of the energetic measures adopted by the Sovereigns of Europe to exterminate the Misanthrope of Corsica, and thus wipe the tears of Humanity, I shall take care to prevent dissemination in these domains of the harmful and false news with which his vile henchmen attempt to unhinge the Universe. I am sending this in reply to the Royal Order 29 April last in which V.E. made this request, Lima, October 12 1815’. \r\n",

The book is obscure and scarce, printed and published provincially, in Newcastle upon Tyne), by an otherwise unknown writer. It was originally intended for publication in 1814, a chronology of the principal events in Napoleon’s life (p. 594) ending with his arrival at Elba on 8 May 1814. But the final chapter, “Congress at Vienna”, notes a delay in publication occasioned by the desire to print notification of the termination of the congress. <br /><br />Such a delay, of course, was extended further by Napoleon’s escape from Elba in February 1815, which disrupted any attempt to give a neat conclusion to the account. This uncertainty over Europe’s trajectory is clear in a speech paraphrased by Hampdon at the end of the book, and given in the House of Commons on 20 March 1815 by Lord Castlereagh (until February 1815 Britain’s representative at the Congress).: “If Bonaparte succeeded in re-establishing his authority in France, peace must be despaired of … The question now was, whether … Europe was again to become a series of armed nations, and whether Great Britain among them was … again to struggle for the independence of the world? These were questions of no small magnitude … depending upon a new and unexpected contest, in which the liberties of mankind were once more assaulted and endangered. … Upon these points there could exist only one feeling, and his lordship trusted that Providence would ordain only one result.” (p. 608). <br /><br />For more information, see the Senate House Library blog here: <a href=\"http://senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/2015/03/02/feature-of-the-month-napoleon-bonaparte-and-the-100-days/\">http://senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/2015/03/02/feature-of-the-month-napoleon-bonaparte-and-the-100-days/</a>",

                "text": "The political philosopher and novelist William Godwin (1756-1836), whose Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793) forecast the elimination of government and the triumph of reason, is not the likeliest supporter of Napoleon. Yet his sparsely annotated Diary reveals a fascination with Napoleon. \r\n\r\nGodwin’s Diary is cryptic: it is mainly an account of what he read, what he wrote and whom he met. There are few references to public events, and these are recorded with brevity. On 1 March 1815, he writes 'Landing of Bonaparte'; on 20 April 1815, ‘Bonaparte’s entry into Paris’; and on 15 July 1815 he notes ‘Surrender of Bonaparte’. While this hardly amounts to obsessive detail we should note three things. Godwin accords no other public events this degree of detail; he has been meticulous in entering these details after the fact, since he would not have been aware of the landing, for example, until the middle of March; and while he makes these entries he starts work on a piece about Napoleon (as can be seen in today's image). For all their brevity, these jottings suggest deep engagement.\r\n\r\nBut a more subtle engagement is also in evidence. Godwin’s references are to Bonaparte, not to Napoleon – the name Godwin uses in the Diary both before and after the 100 Days. For the period of his return, Godwin accords him his status as a man, rather than that of an emperor. After 1815, only Napoleon, or Napoleon Bonaparte are used. It is difficult to read this except as Godwin paying homage to the man and popular hero, and by doing so implicitly to celebrate the return of a force for popular change in France. \r\n",

It is a striking piece of evidence of the continuing appetite of the public for a better understanding of the man. \r\n\r\nShould we take Godwin’s note that he saw only 4 of the 7 sections as evidence of waning interest? That seems unlikely: he would go on to read 'Napoleon in exile; or, A voice from St. Helena. The opinions and reflexions of Napoleon on the most important events of his life and government in his own words.' By Barry E. O'Meara, Esq., his late surgeon (2 volumes) in 1822 and  William Hazlitt’s 'Life of Napoleon Bonaparte' in 1828.\r\n\r\nIt is more likely that, at the age of 75, and in poor health, Godwin found it hard to stay the course.

                "text": "In Britain, the public mood towards Napoleon had dramatically changed since his abdication at the beginning of April 1814. The figure of the defeated despot who had oppressed Europe was giving way to that of the hero who had been unjustly detained on a small Mediterranean island and had boldly defied his captors with a handful of soldiers. By the same token, support for the Bourbons was ebbing away. \r\n\r\nThe novelist and philosopher William Godwin was one of the many British radicals who undertook to refute the claims of the Allies' 'Declaration of Outlawry' of March 1815, in which Napoleon had ben painted as a dangerous usurper of the Bourbon throne. He addressed two long letters to the progressive newspaper Morning Chronicle, at the end of May 1815. The letter reproduced here, signed under the pseudonym of ‘Verax’ (‘truthful’ in Latin), was published on the day the British Parliament voted for war against France. \r\n\r\nBy painting Napoleon as a ‘desperate man, as a chief of banditti’, argued Godwin, the coalition of monarchs had denied the legitimacy of his rule over the French. But if he had been ‘invited’ by the French population, then he was legitimate as a sovereign. What were the just causes for declaring a preventive war against France? Wasn’t it contrary to the established principles of the law of nations to impose a sovereign at the point of a bayonet? Who were Britain’s real foes in the long run, Napoleon or the European despots with whom the British government had chosen to side, who hated the very notion of freedom? Godwin’s rhetorical strategy turned upside down the accusations raised against Napoleon by those in favour of war: he was not the usurper, but Louis XVIII; he was not the tyrant, but those who refused to accept the popular will, with their ‘despotic mandates’; he had not shed blood after landing in the south of France, but the Allied armies would do so if they invaded the country and started a civil war. Ultimately, by siding with the Allies and entering a barbaric war against the French nation, Britain was betraying its cherished moral and political principles, those of humanity, civilization, freedom and representation.  \r\n\r\nFor the background to Godwin's letter, see 'Further Information'.\r\n",

                "text": "The Allied powers faced a dilemma when they heard that Napoleon had escaped from Elba: as his reception in France seemed to prove, their despicable enemy remained hugely popular; how could a new war against Napoleon be justified? One legal solution was to try to detach him from the French: war was not to be waged against a state or a collectivity, but against an individual, with whom Europe could never be at peace. It was he who was to be punished, not those he had duped. \r\n\r\nThis strategy was on display in the so-called Declaration of Outlawry, signed at Vienna by the allied powers (Austria, France, Great Britain, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Spain and Sweden) and published on 13 March 1815. Its language was exceptionally strong. Napoleon had broken the Treaty of Fontainebleau, granting him sovereignty over Elba, and had landed in France, which he would plunge into ‘confusion and disorder’. The responsibility for the legal and military consequences that would follow was placed firmly on Napoleon’s shoulders. Thus, the text read, ‘he has deprived himself of the protection of the law’, and had ‘placed himself without the pale of civil and social relations’. \r\n\r\nIn what many saw as a thinly veiled call for assassination, the Declaration asserted that the fallen Emperor had ‘rendered himself liable to public vengeance’ – a term, as the Duke of Wellington remarked, which originated in a bad English translation of the French ‘vindicte publique’, which he took to mean ‘public justice’. France was urged to make the right choice and support ‘its legitimate sovereign’, the Bourbon Louis XVIII, instead of this ‘enemy and disturber of the tranquility of the world’, animated by a ‘criminal and impotent delirium’. Failing to support its true king, the French nation would face, once again, a military coalition of European powers.\r\nAs Godwin's letter shows, however, this rhetoric did not necessarily convince the British public.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

                "text": "Klemens von Metternich (1773-1859) was an Austrian diplomat of Rhenish origins who rose to become one of the most significant statesmen of the nineteenth century. Following Austria’s multiple defeats at the hands of Napoleonic France and the subsequent enforced alliance, Metternich guided Austria's transition to becoming a member of the grand coalition against Napoleon. He was perhaps the most important figure at the Congress of Vienna, organising the Congress' vast array of festivities and playing a central role in the arrangement of Europe after 1815. \r\n\r\nMetternich had rightly feared Alexander I's lenient attitude towards Napoleon in 1814. The Tsar's decision to grant Bonaparte sovereignty over the Islands of Elba was regarded by Metternich as an unnecessarily dangerous concession to the Emperor. However, upon hearing of Napoleon's return, Metternich used the fear Bonaparte inspired to unite the allies. A strong critic of liberalism, Metternich saw his diplomatic mission as one of restoring harmony to European relations. His goal throughout the Congress was to re-establish equilibrium between the great powers of Europe so that its aristocracy could thrive. Austria and Prussia were to act as a balance in central Europe to French and Russian aggression. Metternich’s pragmatic and largely successful approach to foreign affairs has since made him synonymous with 'Realpolitik'.\r\n\r\nThis research was completed with funding from the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme.",

                "text": "Mounted as a king in a royal equestrian portrait, this tobacco label shows Napoleon in his Imperial regalia. Now part of a collection of trade cards at Waddesdon Manor, the label demonstrates how Napoleon’s image played into the creation of what we could describe as a ‘brand’ identity: he also appears on the label for the perfume or drink called ‘Eau de la Paix’ – Water of Peace, made by Claude Brun and Company, a Distilling Chemists from much earlier in his reign (acc. no. 3686.3.37.92, see <a href=\"http://collection.waddesdon.org.uk/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=42437&amp;db=object\">http://collection.waddesdon.org.uk/search.do?view=detail&amp;page=1&amp;id=42437&amp;db=object</a>). <br /><br />Another label for the same tobacco, also at Waddesdon, gives the location of manufacture as ‘S’ (acc. no. 3686.3.66.140). The word used on the label ‘knaster’ is German, so the tobacco may have been made in somewhere like Strasbourg where both French and German were in use. This was not the only example of Napoleon being associated with tobacco: a Paris tobacconist had the shop sign, 'Au Tabac du Grand Vainqueur', in the form of Napoleon riding into battle (now at Musée Carnavalet, see <a href=\"http://www.artdb.com/fr/oeuvre/au-tabac-du-grand-vainqueur/contexte/musee/musee-carnavalet/onglet/0/debut/5/facettes/\">http://www.artdb.com/fr/oeuvre/au-tabac-du-grand-vainqueur/contexte/musee/musee-carnavalet/onglet/0/debut/5/facettes/</a>). A poem on the back of the shop sign attributes the success of the Emperor to the tobacco. <br /><br />The image of a heroic Napoleon being used to sell tobacco is a reminder that everyday life was full of positive depictions of the Emperor, perhaps influencing the level of popular support for this self-made man.",

                "text": "Hortense (1783-1837) was the daughter of Napoleon’s first wife Josephine. She married Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte, making Napoleon both her stepfather and brother-in-law. Hortense was at the Tuileries to greet the Emperor on 20th March 1815 on his return to Paris, and she wrote on his behalf to Marie-Louise, the Empress, asking her to return to Paris with his son: they had returned to the court in Vienna after Napoleon's first abdication in 1814 and would remain there during the 100 days as Marie-Louise felt that staying put would enhance her son's chances of being allowed by the Allies to accede to his father's throne.\r\nHortense's school friend Louise Cochelet remained close to her and left us memoires recounting her life. She tells us that, in the Empress's absence, Hortense returned to the Tuileries every evening to dine with Napoleon and his guests. She remained faithful to him even in defeat, and gave him her diamond necklace, sewn into a black ribbon in case he needed money in an emergency. While we don’t know for sure that Hortense did the sewing herself, in a matter of such importance it seems quite likely – this sewing kit belonged to her.\r\nForced into exile by the return of Louis XVIII, Hortense eventually settled in Switzerland at Arenenberg, which is now a Napoleon museum with exhibits reflecting both the First Empire and the Second: Hortense's son, Louis Napoleon became President of the Second Republic in 1848 and Napoleon III in a coup d'état in 1851.\r\n",

                "text": "This German print depicts Napoleon dragging a set of conscripts towards the slaughterhouse – from which the blood of earlier victims is streaming, with the carcasses of earlier victims hung as in a butcher’s, beneath signs indicating the death tolls of those conscripted:  Spanish 350,000, German 900,000, Austrian 400,000, Italian 500,000, Egyptian 50,000, St Domingue 55,000.  The dogs are pulled by Napoleon and beaten from behind by the Prefect – Napoleon’s device for ensuring the dominance over the Napoleonic regime over the provinces in France. The sign on the right is a ‘Senatus consultum’ conscripting an additional 380,000 troops.\r\n\r\nThe print may well date from the events prior to 1815, not least since the losses in Russia are not mentioned.  Its significance for the 100 Days, however, concerns the refusal of the newly empowered legislature to agree to conscription, and the failure of the prefects to raise local support for the oncoming war.  Denied conscription, Napoleon decreed that the class of 1815 be classified as discharged soldiers, and therefore as eligible for recall to service, but it was a ruse that raised him only 46,000 troops, who never served in the field.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the failure to recruit locally was a major blow to Napoleon’s claim to represent the spirit of the nation. Faced with the prospect of war, the vast majority of French citizens lacked the stomach for it – unsurprisingly given the death tolls of earlier conflicts.  In the absence of conscription Napoleon had to fall back on the remnants of his imperial guard and the national army – a total of 124,000 men and 358 cannon. When he had moved on Russia in 1812 he had done so with some 450,000 men and he had left over 300,000 fighting the British in Spain. Given the paucity of military support he could call on in 1815, it might be wondered whether he in fact posed the sort of danger that the Congress of Europe claimed.\r\n",

                "text": "Journalistic comment during the 100 days on the production of novels is heavily reminiscent of discussions during the French Revolution 25 years earlier. Commentators in both instances felt that it was wrong to be devoting attention to something as trivial as novels at a time of such political turmoil. Nevertheless, the production of novels continued both during the Revolution and in the 100 days and occasional reviews of novels did still appear. \r\n\r\nIn May 1815, the Journal de Paris remarked that its reading public only wanted political news, but it did review Charles-Antoine-Guillaume Pigault-Lebrun’s novel 'Adélaïde de Méran'. Pigault-Lebrun was one of the most prolific writers of the period, a big name whose publications were too significant to ignore. The novel (which had come out in March 1815) was criticised for containing a villain worse than that to be found in any contemporary melodrama... \r\n\r\nOther new novels appeared during the brief months of Napoleon's return to power but they do not generate reviews in any of the press -  Madame de Méré’s Madame de Lignolles ou fin des aventures de Faublas and Roussel’s Marguerite de Rodolphe, ou l’orpheline du prieuré, both published in late May or early June 1815, are not deemed worthy of displacing reviews of works on Constant’s constitution for instance. \r\n\r\nHistory writers were also affected by the enthusiasm for politics. Séphanie-Félicité de Genlis brought out her 'Histoire de Henri le grand' during the 100 days. She too was a big enough name to have the work reviewed but the reviewers’ comments remind us of the difficulties of timing a publication: Madame de Genlis had, we are told, started the novel years ago but only returned to it in 1814. A year later, when it was ready to publish, it was not really the right time for a royalist publication. It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that the publisher brought out a second edition in 1816 once Louis XVIII was firmly established on the throne once more...\r\n",

It is now part of the 'Tableaux de la Revolution' collected by Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839-1898). A rare survival, the ticket evokes the majesty and tragedy of the Emperor’s comeback in 1815.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of the Champ de Mai, at which Napoleon proclaimed the Acte additionnel to the constitution (see entry for 22 April), emulated the festivities of ancient Rome. On the ticket, the fasces, laurels and eagle recall both Roman symbols and Napoleon’s coronation regalia from December 1804. The putti and cornucopias of Abundance add a festive air, perhaps not fulfilled by the solemn speeches. At the top, the crowned ‘N’ and glory echo messages of God’s acceptance, symbolised by Napoleon’s oath taken on the Gospels. Used on the 1 June, just weeks before Napoleon’s defeat, the ticket must have appealed to Ferdinand as a reminder of the ephemeral nature of power, as much as a souvenir of fleeting history. In his 1896 book, Personal Characteristics of French History, Ferdinand de Rothschild used anecdotes to reflect the shifting ‘drama’ of this period. He ended his book with a sketch of the ‘genius’ Napoleon, a figure he relates to the famous tragic actor Talma, a motif foreshadowing events to come. \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "After the 1809 campaign patriotic literature extolling the virility and martial attributes of German manhood circulated among the Prussian elite. Until 1813 this literature circulated in a largely clandestine manner, but was allowed full expression following Prussia’s declaration of war on France in 1813. That campaign also saw the emergence of a Prussian martyr, the poet and volunteer Theodor Körner. Killed in a skirmish with the French, Körner’s posthumously published poems provided inspiration to educated young men of the Prussian nobility and Bildungsbürgertum, such as Carl von Pfitzner, whose volunteer diary we see here. \r\n\r\nIn 1815 those who had missed out on the War of Liberation in 1813/14 because of their youth saw another opportunity to strike at the French enemy. However, as Pfitzner discovered, not all volunteers were motivated by the same idealistic concerns. Baser motives, such as the chance for enrichment through looting or a belief in the laxer discipline of the volunteer units, motivated many to enlist. Even for those fired with patriotic fervour the campaign of 1815 proved unsatisfactory. Quickly over and fought more for dynastic reasons than for the sake of liberation, the 1815 campaign was overshadowed in the nineteenth-century German popular memory by the War of Liberation and never acquired the same potentially subversive political overtones as 1813. \r\n",

                "text": "'Abschied nach Wien'<br />Contributed by Katherine Hambridge <br /><br />On the first page of his diary, Pfitzner used the martyr poet Körner’s words to express his own feelings on leaving home: 'Leb wohl, leb wohl, mit dumpfen Herzenschlägen', the first line of the 1813 poem 'Abschied nach Wien'.<br /><br />Körner's poetry did not just circulate in text form, but was set to music by the composers of the time. 'Abschied nach Wien', for example, appeared in the Viennese Stephen Franz's collection of <em>Sechs Gedichte von Theodor Körner zum Gesang und Fortepiano </em>(1814)<em>. </em>This song was not to be sung communally, but by a soloist, in a salon or more informal domestic gathering, and the Franz has fully embraced the lyric mode of the text; his fruity harmonic language, and swooping vocal lines emphasise Körner's portrayal of the Romantic subjectivity of the volunteer, both heroic and conflicted in his duty.<br /><br />This poem – and its musical setting – demonstrates the variety of artistic engagements with the war, and the different ways that patriotic sentiment was transmitted.<br /><br />You can listen to a rendition of the Lied <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/research/french/currentprojects/napoleonictheatre/100daysconcert\">here</a>.<br /><strong><br />‘Abschied nach Wien’</strong><br /><div> </div>\n<div>Leb' wohl!

                "text": "The silver medal shown here was produced for members of the Chamber of representatives to use for the 1815 session. The medal bears the profile of a helmeted Pallas Athena and the signature of the engraver on one side, and the inscriptions « Chambre des Représentans », and « session de l’année 1815 » on the other. The terminology allows us to date this to the 100 days since the Charte of 1814 had created a « Chambre des députés », not « des représentans ». The choice of imagery from Antiquity also fits better the protocol of the Empire when abundant use was made of classical art, whereas the Restoration preferred to use a portrait of the King.  \r\n\r\nRepresentatives’ medals appeared during the early Revolution and they primarily served as a means of identification. From 1791 public agents were given a medal describing their function and often bearing phrases such as ‘The Law’ (for judges in the appeal court) or ‘the Law and the King’ (the King’s commissioners). The medal may not equate entirely with the batons of Ancient Roman generals but it was nevertheless proof of the authority invested in its bearer. Given to each Member of Parliament, the medals such as this had to be shown by those entering the assembly to prove that they had been duly elected and verified. These were not, therefore, simply commemorative or honorific medals or decorative trinkets but an identifier linked to the function of the assembly and the security of its operations. They served as proof of identify or, when counting votes, as evidence of someone’s presence in the chamber. The medals therefore have a double significance; they are both symbolic and practical. \r\n\r\nTo read the original entry in French, see 'Further information'.\r\n",

Jeuffroy, 1749-1826, membre de l’Institut à compter de 1803 et directeur de la Monnaie en l’an XI), à l’usage des membres de la « Chambre des Représentans », pour la « session de l’année 1815 ». Elle présente une tête de Pallas casquée sous son profil gauche, avec la signature du graveur à l’avers, et les inscriptions au revers. La mention « Chambre des Réprésentans » permet de la distinguer comme l’une de celles dont les députés des Cent-Jours eurent en mains, car la Charte de 1814 créé une « Chambre des députés » et non « des Représentans ». Le choix de l’Antique sied enfin mieux au décorum de l’Empire qui y a recouru abondamment – la Restauration préfèrerait un portrait du roi.\r\n\r\nLes médailles des députés apparaissent dans les premières assemblées révolutionnaires où, remise à chacun des parlementaires elle ont une fonction première d’identification. Elle permettent en effet d’assurer qu’une personne pénétrant dans l’enceinte de l’assemblée et prenant part à ses opérations est effectivement représentant, dument « élu et vérifié ».\r\nSans remonter à l’Ancien Régime, dès 1791, les agents publics reçoivent une médaille, décrite avec l’ensemble des marques de leurs fonctions (essentiellement uniformes), portant d’ailleurs des mentions telles que « La Loi » (juges au Tribunal de Cassation) ou « La Loi & Le Roi » (commissaires du Roi). Ce signe, s’il n’équivaut pas tout à fait aux antiques bâtons de commandement des généraux romains, n’en est pas moins preuve de l’autorité dont ils sont les dépositaires investis.\r\n",

                "text": "On 4 June 1815 the Chamber of representatives chose Jean-Denis Lanjuinais (1753-1827) as its president. Lanjuinais represented the liberal tradition of the French Revolution and had been a constant opponent of the Bonapartist regime. As member of the Senate, he had been one of the few to protest against the creation of the Empire in 1804 and had played an important role in the removal of the Emperor in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe result of the vote, with Lanjuinais winning an overwhelming majority, was a snub to the Emperor given that, according to Article 7 of the Act Additional of 22 April 1815, the representatives were elected by the people on whom Napoleon was basing his political legitimacy. The plebiscitary nature of the First Empire had meant that such elections under previous versions of the constitution had not really affected Napoleon but this time it was very different.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the details of the election of the president and of the extent of Lanjuinais’ success, the minutes of the session of 4 June 1815 also give us valuable information about the functioning of the new Act Additional. According to article 8 of the Act Additional, there are 629 members of the Chamber of representatives but the minutes show there were only 472 voting in the first round and 427 in the second, that is to say almost one third of the total number of representatives were not involved. Some were absent or late for various reasons, some had not yet been formally confirmed in their powers (article 10 indicates that the Chamber of representatives had to verify the credentials of its members and pronounce upon the validity of contested elections). The minutes of the session from 3 June indicate that the Ministry of the Interior was sending over in batches election results for the chamber to scrutinise. But the formal requirement to verify election results meant that Lucien Bonaparte was not able to be present for the election for president and therefore could not provide the sort of support for Napoleon that he had during the coup d’état of 1799.\r\n\r\nThe votes show that the liberals, with Lanjuinais exemplifying their re-found energy, are making a strong political comeback in contrast with those loyal to the Empire such as Merlin de Douai. In more general terms we also see a return of members of the revolutionary assemblies of the 1790s.\r\n\r\nThe election of Lanjuinais to the presidency of the Chamber of representatives did not bode well for the Emperor who had been hoping to regain control of the political situation which had been slipping from his control since his arrival back in Paris. It seems that he even hesitated as to whether he should approve the appointment (see article 9 of the Act which stipulated that the appointment of president is submitted to the Emperor for approval) according Lanjuinais’ son (see V.-A. Lanjuinais, Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de J.-D. Lanjuinais, in J.-D. Lanjuinais, Œuvres, Paris, Dondey-Dupré, 1832, t. 1, p. 65-66.)\r\n\r\nFor the full article in French and a transcript of the minutes of the meeting on 4 June 1815, see Further Information.",

                "text": "Le 4 juin 1815, la Chambre des Représentants désigne son président et choisi Jean-Denis Lanjuinais (1753-1827), figure emblématique de la Révolution française, dans sa version libérale, et opposant constant du régime bonapartiste (il proteste presque seul au Sénat, contre l’établissement de l’Empire, et il joue un rôle important dans la première chute de l’Aigle, en 1814, en tant que sénateur).\r\n\r\nUn tel résultat, acquis largement au profit de Lanjuinais, constitue un camouflet pour l’Empereur, car les Représentants sont les « élus du peuple » (art. 7 de l’Acte additionnel aux constitutions de l’Empire – la « Benjamine » – du 22 avril 1815), à l’adhésion duquel Napoléon attache sa légitimité politique fondamentale. Le caractère plébiscitaire du Ier Empire n’était point gêné par l’élection sous les précédentes versions de la constitution, il en va différemment durant les Cent-Jours.\r\n\r\nLe procès-verbal de cette séance du 4 juin 1815, au-delà de ce qu’il nous apprend de la procédure de désignation du président et sur le succès de cet opposant, nous apporte d’autres informations significatives. \r\n\r\nSelon l’art. 8 de l’Acte additionnel, les Représentants sont au nombre de 629, alors que le PV décompte 472 (1er tour de scrutin) puis 427 (2nd tour de scrutin) votants, soit une différence de 150 à 200 suffrages (presque un tiers de l’effectif théorique de l’assemblée). Les suffrages manquants sont ceux des députés absents (simplement absents ou en retard pour diverses raisons) et représentants « ajournés », c’est-à-dire ceux dont on n’a pas encore pu vérifier la validité de l’élection. L’Acte additionnel, art. 10 précise en effet que « La Chambre des représentants vérifie les pouvoirs de ses membres, et prononce sur la validité des élections contestées ». La fin de la séance du 3 juin (PV, p. 22) indique que certains procès-verbaux d’élection sont transmis progressivement par le Ministre de l’Intérieur à la Chambre. Cette formalité nécessaire interdit par exemple à Lucien Bonaparte de siéger le 4 juin (PV, p. 23), lors de l’élection du président – or Lucien, malgré ses relations erratiques avec Napoléon, est l’un de ses plus habiles soutiens politiques dans les assemblées comme il fut l’un des artisans du 18 brumaire à Saint-Cloud).\r\n\r\nPar ailleurs, ce suffrage marque le retour en force des Libéraux, dont Lanjuinais illustre la vigueur, face aux serviteurs de l’Empire (Merlin de Douai, par exemple), et d’une manière plus générale, le retour des membres des assemblées révolutionnaires depuis 1789.\r\n\r\nL’élection de Lanjuinais à la Présidence de la Chambre des Députés augure de grandes difficultés pour l’Empereur, dans la reconquête et la maîtrise d’un jeu politique qui tend à lui échapper depuis son arrivée à Paris.\r\n\r\nIl semble bien que Napoléon ait hésité à approuver (art. 9 de l’Acte additionnel) la nomination de Lanjuinais, ainsi qu’en témoigne le récit laissé par V. Lanjuinais des événements de la vie de son père (V.-A. Lanjuinais, Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de J.-D. Lanjuinais, in J.-D. Lanjuinais, Œuvres, Paris, Dondey-Dupré, 1832, t. 1, p. 65-66.)\r\n\r\nTranscription\r\n« PRESIDENCE DE M. DE BRANGES , Doyen d’âge.\r\nSéance du 4 Juin 1815.\r\nM. LE PRESIDENT ouvre la séance. UN DES SECRETAIRES donne lecture du procès-verbal de celle du 3 juin.\r\nUN MEMBRE fait observer, relativement à l’admission des Représentants du département de l’Isère, qu’il est essentiel d’exprimer que l’ajournement prononcé à l’égard du prince Lucien et de son suppléant, est fondé sur les mêmes motifs que les autres ajournements.\r\nCette observation est adoptée.\r\nUN AUTRE MEMBRE propose que, lors des appels nominaux et dans les procès-verbaux des séances, il ne soit donné aux membres de l’Assemblée d’autre qualification que celle de Représentant. C’est, dit-il, une mesure de police intérieure que je présente sans rien entendre préjuger sur la question des titres.\r\nL’orateur se livre à ce sujet à quelques développements, dans lesquels il est interrompu par les réclamations d’ajournement et d’ordre du jour.\r\nUN MEMBRE appuie l’ajournement par le motif que la Chambre ne doit s’occuper, en ce moment, que de ce qui est relatif à sa constitution définitive. La première proposition n’a pas de suite.\r\nLa Chambre adopte la rédaction du procès-verbal.\r\nM. LE PRESIDENT communique une lettre du Ministre de l’intérieur, annonçant que, d’après les ordres de l’Empereur, la liste des membres de la Chambre des Pairs ne sera arrêtée et publiée qu’après l’ouverture de la session.\r\nUN MEMBRE, exprimant quelque surprise à cet égard, insiste sur l’idée qu’il serait essentiel que la liste des membres de la Chambre des Pairs fût communiquée à celle des Représentants.\r\nPLUSIEURS MEMBRES réclament l’ordre du jour.\r\nM. LE PRESIDENT rappelle que l’intention de la Chambre est de procéder immédiatement à la nomination de son Président.\r\nOn propose qu’il soit formé plusieurs bureaux pour, le dépouillement du scrutin.\r\nLa Chambre manifestant le désir que quatre scrutateurs seulement, désignés par la voie du sort, soient adjoints au Bureau, M. le Président tire de l’urne les noms de MM. Champigny-Aubin, Thevenard-Guérin, Gillet-Barba, Richaud.\r\nLes quatre scrutateurs désignés prennent place au Bureau.\r\nUN DES SECRETAIRES fait l’appel nominal, et MM. les Scrutateurs inscrivent les noms des membres qui viennent déposer leur bulletin.\r\nL’appel et le réappel terminés, MM. les Scrutateurs constatent que le nombre des votants est de 472, nombre égal à celui des bulletins.\r\nLe scrutin est ensuite dépouillé, et M. le Président en proclame le résultat ainsi qu’il suit :\r\nLe nombre des votants était de………..472\r\nMajorité absolue………..……………...237\r\nMM.\tSuffrages.\r\nLe comte Lanjuinais.\t189\r\nFlaugergues.\t74\r\nLe général Lafayette.\t51\r\nLafayette (sans désignation) [Georges, Louis, Gilbert, Washington du MOTIER de LAFAYETTE (1779-1849), fils du précédent, député de la Haute-Loire à la chambre des Cents-Jours.].\t17\r\nMerlin (de Douai).\t41\r\nMerlin (sans désignation).\t3\r\nDupont (de l’Eure).\t29\r\nBédoch\t24\r\nLe comte Regnault de Saint-Jean d’Angely.\t6\r\nVouty-Latour.\t6\r\nLe général Carnot.\t5\r\nLe comte Boulay.\t5\r\nGarat.\t4\r\nDumolard,\t4\r\nDubois ( d’Angers ).\t4\r\nDeferrnon.\t2\r\nRoy.\t2\r\nMalherbe.\t2\r\nLe baron Rémond.\t2\r\nLe comte Stanislas Girardin.\t1\r\nBarrère.\t1\r\nIl est procédé dans les mêmes formes à un second tour de scrutin.\r\nLe dépouillement terminé, M. le Président en fait connaître le résultat :\r\nLe nombre des votants était de………..427\r\nMajorité absolue………..……………...214\r\nMM.\tSuffrages.\r\nLe comte Lanjuinais.\t277\r\nLe général Lafayette.\t75\r\nFlaugergues.\t59\r\nLe comte Boulay.\t5\r\nBédoch.\t4\r\nMerlin (de Douai).\t3\r\nDupont.\t2\r\nGarat.\t1\r\nVouty-Latour.\t1\r\nIl prononce, en conséquence, que M. le comte Lanjuinais est nommé Président de la Chambre des Représentants.\r\nLa Chambre arrête que le procès-verbal de cette nomination sera porté à l’Empereur par M. le Président provisoire.\r\nLe procès-verbal de cette opération est de suite soumis à l’approbation de la Chambre.\r\nLa séance est levée et ajournée au lendemain à neuf heures du matin.\r\nSigné DE BRANGES, Doyen d’âge.\r\nDELACROIX et F.

His responsibilities are under his feet marked, among other things, ‘the Charter’, ‘forgetting the past’, and ‘freedom of the press’. To the right is Napoleon, working at a table with little food and drink, with a pile of papers whose labels include ‘freedom of religion’ and ‘the abolition of slavery’. He is signing a document releasing from prison the Duc d’Angoulême, the Comte d’Artois’ son.\r\n\r\nThis was part of a series of illustrations favourable to Napoleon printed after his return to France. This one was meant to highlight the differences between the two regimes, the two styles of governance, and the characters of the two monarchs. Napoleon had the reputation for being incredibly hardworking. Louis XVIII, on the other hand, had not made a good impression on the people of France since his return from exile in May 1814. \r\n",

Sergeant Wheeler, who was stationed in Grammont (Geraardsbergen) wrote home about an incident in early June:\r\nIn the great square, opposite the Guildhall, there is a fountain, in the middle stands a naked boy, apparently about four years old, his left hand rested on his hip, and with his right he held his little c------out of which the water flowed into the basin or more properly the well, for it is some twelve feet deep. One night some of our officers had been indulging themselves rather too much, they sallied out in quest of adventures, they managed to get a rope round the neck of the little urchin and pull him off his perch. He being made of lead, down he sank to the bottom of the well.\r\nFortunately the manneken pis was recovered unharmed and the incident forgotten.\r\n\r\nWeekly horse races were held at Grammont for the entertainment of the officers. On Saturday 3 June the Earl of Uxbridge announced a gold cup worth 50 guineas to be competed for by officers riding their own chargers over 280 yards with sabre in hand. Half-way through the racing a torrential downpour forced the seventy officers taking part to retire to an old house where the Mayor of Ninove served ‘an excellent cold dinner, liberally lubricated with champagne’. \r\n\r\nTo find out what happened at - and after - dinner, see Further Information.",

The maddest rushed headlong into a race to the bell tower, across the fields, at night, and gave the peasants some idea of the independence of the English Hussars by shouting in the village streets ‘Long Live Napoleon!’ \r\n\r\nLast of all – and I should not forget to mention the fact, because the thing happened or I dreamed it, - they turned over two carriages and frightened the ladies inside into nervous fits, while charging their husbands and protectors in the true Cossack manner.\r\n\r\nThe following day they got the bill: 979 francs for wine, 730 for food and 90 for service, amounting to a charge of 50 francs for each officer of the brigade. A number of complaints had been made to the general, they expected that they would also face a bill for the damage they had caused and the mayor of Ninove declared that he would never have anything more to do with such a band of English Cossacks. One officer suffered an ‘apoplexy’ from which he never recovered. ",

                "text": "For Romantic poet and novelist Alfred de Vigny, the first Restoration was a personal as well as a political milestone: in July 1814, he was commissioned in one of the four corps of the royal household. Though nursing a broken leg, he hastened to Versailles on Napoleon’s return and escorted Louis XVIII into exile, with the Emperor’s lancers in hot pursuit. He was confined to Amiens for the remainder of the 100 Days: Napoleon had reportedly said of the royal guards that ‘they were good fellows who had done their duty, but [he] did not wish to see them in Paris’.\r\n\r\nVigny was to draw on his experience in 'Servitude et grandeur militaires'. The work barely touches on the 100 Days, beyond recalling the torrential rain that marked the King’s flight and the mud of Flanders. Vigny laments his own ‘useless passion for arms’, and proposes a history of his whole generation. Napoleon’s exploits incited those born around 1800 — obsessed, as Vigny says, by the image of an unsheathed sword — to anticipate a future of military glory. The years in which Vigny bore uniform were to be altogether unglorious, though he did receive the Napoleonic Légion d’honneur for his service to the royal household. What Vigny’s work portrays is the stirring, though now residual, grandeur of those who had witnessed and participated in the Imperial wars: the long years of the Second Restoration were to be the period when Napoleon’s fateful hold on the hearts and minds of one generation was finally expiated.\r\n\r\n",

A letter to Gustave Planche of June 1832 recalls Louis’s difficult passage through Flanders. Though the novel was one of the first, like Musset’s La Confession d’un enfant du siècle, to depict the legendary ‘mal du siècle’ of the post-Revolutionary generation, it was caustically received in the press of the time.\r\n\r\nServitude et grandeur militaires — the original edition of 1835 http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8626378z.r=.langFR\r\n\r\nVigny’s military career is documented in the most recent edition of his letters; see Alfred de Vigny, Correspondance, ed. by Madeleine Ambrière, I (Paris: Garnier, 2012), pp. 440–50, where mention is made of his service in the 100 Days. For the fragment of the letter to Planche describing his hazardous progress with the King through Flanders, see Irving Massey, ‘Two unpublished letters of Alfred de Vigny’, Studies in Romanticism, 3, No. 3 (Spring 1964), 186 –89",

                "text": "Seren Gomer (‘Star of Gomer’) was the first Welsh-language weekly newspaper, launched in Swansea by the Baptist minister Joseph Harris, and catering to a lively, highly literate community of readers across Wales. \r\n\r\nIts 86 issues ran from January 1814 to August 1815. Four densely-packed pages offered a mix of local, national and international news digested and translated from various sources, interspersed with advertisements, poetry and letters. From March 1815, Napoleon haunts its pages.\r\n\r\nThe item for June 8th, ‘Ymlediad y Gwrthrhyfel yn Ffraingc’ (‘Spread of the Rebellion in France’), appears in issue 77. Published on June 14th, it relates events previously reported in French newspapers on the 4th and 5th, concerning Napoleon’s Generals Soult and Bertrand, who have gone ahead to join the army in Flanders: ‘they set out on Monday and expect the Emperor to join them on Tuesday’. \r\n\r\nThe time-lag in the narration of news is a distinctive, and to modern eyes, oddly disconcerting, feature of provincial newspapers of this period. Items on the first page are already a leisurely week behind the publication date, and readers working through the paper (if that is indeed how they were read) would have been brought gradually up to date, revising their knowledge in the process. \r\n\r\nWhen the news is in itself a gripping day-by-day narrative, as Napoleon’s march up through France certainly was, one has the added complexity of a moving target, and immense difficulty in authenticating sources. Anxieties about the correctness of information are a constant editorial theme: an issue from March 29th carries a fulsome and rather defensive apology for the misreporting of Napoleon’s ‘capture’ the previous week, laying the blame firmly on its source, the unreliable Bristol Monitor.\r\n\r\nEntry continues in 'Further Information'.\r\n",

                "text": "On the back page of issue 77 is a rather flowery letter signed Dafydd Glantren, describing an early morning walk along the shoreline, where the sight of the mighty ocean, he recounts, moved him to various thoughts:\r\nTybiais fod Prydain yn ddedwydd iawn fod ganddi cylch o ddwfr o’i hamgylch; ond yn fwyaf neillduol daeth i’m meddwl am adferiad Alltud Elba i’r orsedd drachefn, a thebygolrwydd tywallt rhagor o waed dynion; rhy debygol yw y bydd i’r march coch gael ei ollwng eleni eto.   \r\nI thought how fortunate Britain is to have a circle of water around her; and more specifically, I thought of the Exile of Elba and his return to the throne, of the likelihood that men’s blood will be spilled; how likely it is that the red horse will be loosed again this year.  \r\nHe then notes how ungrateful people have been for the brief peace, in particular those making money out of war with France; now, he says, they have their desire, and many will die before peace returns again.   \r\nRead with historical hindsight, this issue of Seren Gomer is tense with pre-Waterloo build-up. The battle itself is oddly out of focus. One always thinks of big historical dates as somehow instantly and simultaneously significant; but even the following issue, 21st June, can only tell its readers, in a hurried post-script on page three, that they have heard that the fighting in Belgium ‘has begun’. Further news about the final battle seems to seep out rather anticlimactically throughout July – presumably long after the bells had stopped ringing in Swansea. Coincidentally but rather aptly, the narrative arc of the Hundred Days mirrors the last months of the paper itself; the Seren got into irretrievable financial difficulties and folded in August. In its final issue the two ‘stars’ set out together, as, on the very last page, Harris took leave of his readers ˗ alongside news of the Bellerophon heading for St Helena.\r\n",

Delegates, lobbyists and spectators from across Europe assembled in Vienna from September 1814 through June 1815 to redraw Europe’s borders and political rules at a moment when a majority of Europeans faced changes of ruler and regime. \r\n\r\nWhile most great power conflicts in the negotiations were resolved before the Hundred Days, Napoleon’s return did spur delegates to hasten the final agreements, in order to present an official version before war recommenced. To bolster the settlement’s moral and political weight, the statesmen of the major powers decided to combine the numerous separate treaties among the various states into one massive document, the Vienna Final Act.\r\n\r\nThe signature page of the Austrian copy pictured here showcases one of the fruits of the Congress: the powers appear in alphabetical order according to the new diplomatic rules established there as a way of reducing disputes over precedence. The signatures, personal wax seals and coloured national binding threads contributed to the treaty’s lasting symbolic value. \r\n\r\nThe original was hastily signed on 9 June 1815 before the leading statesmen departed to join the Allied headquarters ahead of the climactic encounter at Waterloo, even before the final articles were included. The signatures and seals for the official states’ copies like this one had to be tracked down across Europe over the following weeks. \r\n",

                "text": "In this pamphlet from 1815, bishop of Barcelona directed his parishioners to support the king, Ferdinand VII, in his new war against Napoleon. The city of Barcelona had had considerable exposure to Napoleonic ideas having been in French hands during the six years of the Peninsular War (1808-14). It was also the last city to be abandoned by Napoleon’s soldiers after Paris surrendered to the Allied coalition in 1814.  \r\n\r\nHere the bishop attacks Napoleon as a disturber of empires and a violator of the principles of equity, justice, social order and religion; the Treaty of Fontainebleau that had followed Napoleon’s defeat in 1814 is denounced for having allowed his return. However, the central claim of the text is that the return of Napoleon should be understood as a divine punishment for the Spanish people for their corruption, and their contempt and disregard for the Catholic religion. The bishop urged the Spanish people to redeem themselves through their vows, prayers and penances, and thereby to regain the favor of God. And he directed priests to behave as vassals of the king, to assist the king in meeting the expenses of the war, and to ensure that the city’s young people were not corrupted by the perverse ideas of Napoleon’s supporters.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet reveals the Bishop’s fears that Barcelona might take up the Napoleonic cause. Indeed, a few years later Barcelona became the first city in which “liberals” (Spanish revolutionaries) were reconciled with “afrancesados” (collaborators with the Napoleonic occupation). It was also the first city in Spain to honour Napoleon on his death and to record its admiration for him.  For all the Bishop’s warning, at least some residents of Barcelona clearly welcomed Napoleon’s return in 1815. \r\n",

                "text": "The British novelist and poet Helen Maria Williams (1759–1827) was an astute social commentator and historian. Having created a stir with her pro-Revolutionary 'Letters written in France in the summer 1790', she returned to commenting on events taking place in France during the 100 days. Her 'A Narrative of the Events which Have Taken Place in France from the Landing of Napoleon Bonaparte on the First of March 1815, till the Restoration of Louis XVIII' was published the same year.\r\n\r\nLetter 9 of her Narrative recounts the series of political events taking place in June, from Napoleon’s resurrection of the ancient tradition of the Field of May to the establishment of a Chamber of Representatives. She wrote that ‘the more reflecting citizens of Paris mourned over the evils which menaced their unhappy country. The armies of Europe already begirted its frontiers, and the miseries of civil war desolated its western coasts. Napoleon, however reluctant to depart, saw the necessity of joining his army, and only waited to receive the address of the legislature in answer to his imperial speech at the opening of the session.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the address of the legislature was not entirely appealing to Bonaparte. The newly established Chamber of Representatives nominated Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais as President (see the object for 4th June). Williams aptly noted the mutual dislike between Lanjuinais and Bonaparte. She commented on Bonaparte’s impatience with the administrative constraints of democracy, illustrated in his condescending tone: ‘‘You may meditate,’ says he, ‘on the constitution I have given you; you may prepare organic regulations; but, beware, touch not the ark itself: you know the danger that awaits such profanation. My ministers will tell you the rest.’’\r\n\r\nThere was little hiding Williams’ perspective on the situation. She clearly saw Bonaparte not as a liberating hero but as an oppressive and arrogant tyrant. ‘When all the ceremonials were completed’, she wrote, ‘Bonaparte, smiling within himself at his re-shackled slaves, set off for the frontier’. Though unsatisfied with the Chamber of Representatives, and with allegiances and borders in dispute, Napoleon set off for the fields of Belgium on 12th June. \r\n",

                "text": "The correspondence between the Duke of Wellington and Lord Lynedoch in June vividly depicts the Duke’s confidence and decisive attitude as the inevitable clash of armies approached. On 13th June 1815, he wrote:\r\n\r\n‘There is nothing new here. We have reports of Bonaparte’s joining the army and attacking us; but I have accounts from Paris of the 10th, on which day he was still there; and I judge from his speech to the Legislature that his departure was not likely to be immediate. I think we are now too strong for him here.’ (See Antony Brett-James, Wellington At War 1794-1815: A selection of his wartime letters. (London: Macmillan & Co LTD, 1961), p.307).\r\n\r\nIn fact, Napoleon had left Paris on 12th June and the decisive period of fighting would begin sooner than Wellington had expected. Nevertheless, his assessment of the relative strengths of the armies was borne out.\r\n \r\nToday Wellington is remembered not just for his involvement in Waterloo but also for a new style of boot that would take his name: the Wellington. Wellington had asked his shoemaker to adapt the standard hessian-style boot by cutting the tassel and lowering the heel to make them a more comfortable fit. The epic victory at Waterloo in 1815 marked Wellington as fashion pioneer and the wellington was adopted thereafter as a fashion trend. \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "On 13 June the Duke of Wellington accompanied the young Lady Jane Lennox to a cricket match at in the park of the duke of Arenberg near Enghien, where the Guards regiments were based. There had been earlier games and, from diary entries, we know that Lord Hill's aide-de-camp Digby Mackworth played or watched there on 7 and 11 June. \r\n\r\nLady Jane’s father, the Duke of Richmond, who had helped found the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1787, was playing along with General Peregrine Maitland, commander of the 1st Guards Brigade, who also played cricket for the MCC and was soon to elope with Jane’s elder sister Sarah. \r\n\r\nThat these society events were taking place in Belgium in the run up to Waterloo might seem surprising. But by this time the date for the invasion of France by the allies had been set and Wellington was doing his best to maintain an air of insouciance, as if no great event were in the offing. These were the first cricket matches known to have been played in Belgium.\r\n",

                "text": "Today’s object is a letter dated 13 June 1815 written by François de Jaucourt, Louis XVIII’s acting foreign minister while Talleyrand was away at the Congress of Vienna. His correspondent was Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, whom Louis XVIII had sent on mission to Hamburg during the 100 days. Bourrienne had in fact previously spent a number of years in Hamburg as Napoleon’s consul there but he had been recalled for profiteering in 1813. In 1814, Bourrienne had gone over to the royalist cause and during the 100 days had followed the King into exile.\r\n \r\nJaucourt presents the delay in beginning the military campaign as strategic and proof of the unity of the Allies. He is confident that the uprising in the Vendée will aid their cause and is at pains to highlight the extent to which the usurper Buonaparte is discredited in Paris, despite the smoke and mirrors of the Champ de Mai festivities. \r\n\r\nIn talking up the Royalist and Allied situation, Jaucourt was hoping to reinforce Bourrienne’s loyalty to the King, not least because the finances no longer stretch to paying those sent on mission in his Majesty’s name... Bourrienne is encouraged to see the demonstration of his loyalty as reward enough...\r\n\r\nA postscript added on 16th June announces that hostilities have commenced against Napoleon’s troops.\r\n\r\nYou can read a transcription of the letter under Further Information.",

                "text": "A Monsieur Bourrienne, Ministre de France à Hambourg\r\n\r\nCirculaire\r\nGand, le 14 juin 1815\r\n\r\nMonsieur si depuis ma lettre du 29 mai, les évènemens n’ont pas encore pris une tournure plus décisive, c’est que l’ensemble et la simultanéité des mesures et des opérations fait une partie essentielle du systême des Alliés. Ce retard même prouve leur union parfaite et d’ailleurs tout annonce qu’il ne s’étendra plus au de là de peu de jours.\r\n\r\nCependant la Vendée n’a pas attendu l’époque du commencement des hostilités pour résister à l’oppression dont elle était menacée par l’usurpateur, et les nouvelles que nous recevons de ce côté là nous font espérer que les efforts n’auront pas été prématurés et qu’ils ne seront pas inutiles au succès de notre cause.\r\n\r\nLes scènes qui dans l’intervalle ont été jouées à Paris, n’ont pu produire et n’ont produit en effet aucun changement dans la disposition générale des esprits en France. Nous apprenons même qu’elles y ont augmenté la déconsidération où est tombé Napoléon Buonaparte et dont l’arrivée à Compiegne de Joachim Murat ne le relèvera pas.\r\n\r\nIl paraît que les soins à donner à la rédaction définitive des actes du Congrès de Vienne y ont retenu Mr le Prince de Talleyrand, ainsi que les Plénipotentiaires de plusieurs autres puissances, pendant les premiers jours qui ont suivi le départ des souverains ; mais son arrivée à Bruxelles et à Gand aura lieu incessamment.\r\n\r\nC’est, Monsieur, à la veille des grands évènemens qui rendront à la France son Roi légitime et le repos à l’Europe que vous mériterez cette confiance dont vous trouverez les motifs dans la sainteté de la cause du Roi, dans l’admiration des Alliés et dans la loyauté de vos propres sentimens. En langage simple sans exaltation et conforme aux principes que le Roi proclamait par la Charte Constitutionnelle et auxquels il restera toujours attaché ; une conduite modeste, des communications franches et sans prétentions soit avec les personnes de la ville où vous résidez, soit avec les agens des autres puissances,  vous mettront à portée de profiter de toutes les occasions pour servir utilement le Roi et la Patrie, et ajouteront à l’estime due à votre propre caractère.\r\n\r\nLe Roi, en autorisant à rentrer en France les consuls dont les moyens de fortune personnelle ne leur permettraient point de continuer à le servir en restant à leur poste, vous a fait assez connaître combien il lui serait difficile en ce moment d’assurer les traitemens et les secours accoutumés à des serviteurs placés dans les pays Etrangers. Par la même raison sa Majesté doit s’en rapporter à ses Ministres accrédités en dehors pour la plus ou moins grande latitude qu’ils croiront dans les circonstances actuelles pouvoir donner à leurs dépenses de représentation. Elle est persuadée que ce qu’ils croiraient pour l’instant devoir en retrancher sera abondamment compensé par la considération personnelle dont ils jouissent et par la dignité même qui s’attache à une situation si propre à mettre en évidence leur fidélité et leur dévouement.\r\n\r\nDu reste, si dans cette situation, les occasions de vous transmettre les ordres du Roi peuvent pendant quelque temps encore être moins fréquentes, vous en trouverez toujours pour donner des preuves d’un zèle que sa Majesté se plait à apprécier. Je vous prierai surtout de me tenir au courant de tous les évènemens qui pourront nous intéresser, des mouvemens militaires, des nouvelles  et même des bruits qui se rapporteront aux circonstances actuelles. Ce qui ne serait pas digne d’entrer dans une dépêche pourrait faire la matière de bulletins que vous me ferez parvenir régulièrement tous les jours de courrier.\r\n\r\nRecevez, Monsieur, les assurances de ma considération très distinguée.\r\nJaucourt\r\n\r\nP.S. Du 16 juin. Les papiers de Paris du 12 nous avaient annoncé hier le départ de Buonaparte pour son armée. En ce moment nous recevons la nouvelle qu’il  a fait un mouvement sur Charleroi par Avesnes et Maubeug et que les hostilités sont commencées.

                "text": "On 16th June 1815, Claire de Duras wrote to Germaine de Staël from the royal camp in Ghent. The letter – translated in 'Further Information' – continually oscillates between the personal and the political, and offers a unique perspective on current events and the figure of Napoleon. \r\n\r\nFrom its content, we must assume that the letter was composed in two stages. The pessimistic first part appears to be written before news of the events which had taken place at the Duchess of Richmond's ball the previous night had reached Ghent: it was at this ball in Brussels that the Duke of Wellington received the news that Napoleon had crossed into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (now Belgium). \r\n\r\nThe second part, added later, completes the letter by offering a lively description and response to those events.\r\n\r\nToday's object is the Duchess of Richmond's list of invitees to the ball; the original letter from de Duras is now lost. The Comte d’Haussonville, in his work on 'La Baronne de Staël et la Duchesse de Duras' (Paris: Figaro, 1910) published a transcript of it, mentioning in the paratextual material the famous fictional depictions of the Duchess of Richmond’s ball: Byron’s portrayal in Childe Harold, Thackeray’s in Vanity Fair. \r\n\r\nHowever, this almost eye-witness account captures not only the frenzied events of that night, but also the fear that the war had produced, the return to previous uncertainties that it evoked, and the personal suffering that it caused. The swift change of tone in Duras’s letter between the two parts portrays the ball as a great turning point in the narrative of the 100 Days.\r\n",

                "text": "Ghent, 16 June\r\n\r\nOh, you are right to reproach me! It is inexcusable to not have responded to your original letter. My first thought when I arrived in Brussels was actually to write to you. I felt the need to be close to you again, and to talk to you about what was on my mind, but, then, I became so miserable! I lost the best mother: she loved only me and I was her sole concern in life. \r\n\r\nShe had wanted to follow me to Belgium without thinking about her age or her health. A fatal stroke took her from me in an instant! At five o'clock, she was cheerful and happy; at eight o’clock, she was no longer with us. I cannot describe to you the depths of sadness, of despondency, that her loss has plunged me in. I cannot tell you how a void has opened up around me, and how I have blamed myself for having brought her here, as it has transformed all other sorrows. I could no longer say the same things to you, and I would not have dared reveal myself as so sad and so incapable of talking about what would have interested you: the current events.\r\n\r\nI came here, and for two months, I have done nothing. I barely write to Mme de La Tour du Pin; I write to no one. There is so much to say, and now the scene is changing, as hostilities began yesterday between Mauberge and Mons. Napoleon fired the first shots of the canons. We don’t know any of the details as the courier, who arrived at two o'clock that night, left when the action began. I think that the outposts will be retaken, like always happens. It will be seen as a victory for France, and will be worth thousands of conscripts for the Empire.\r\n\r\nI don't think that we will stay here with the war. There is already talk of going to Antwerp. M. de Talleyrand has not yet arrived and we’re waiting for him to say the word. Unfortunately, now the question rests upon the shots of a canon. Certainly for me, the war and our poor country’s misfortunes are tearing at my heart. It pains me to think of what I shall gain through such means, and that, only through war, I am condemned to have my life back. At this price, I could be tempted to not want it, but, at least like Pilate, I declare myself innocent from the blood of the righteous – and yet what other choice do we have? Without fighting, France will remain in the hands of a man who has not changed, because people don’t change. He will be a tyrant, the conqueror of an occupied land! This is the product of our madness, of our light touch, and of our unforgivable lack of foresight.\r\n\r\nYour daughter’s marriage has been put on hold then; Mathieu even said to me that it had broken down. In your place, I would not worry about someone, who could not sacrifice the advantages of a large fortune for your lovely Albertine. To be worthy of her, he must love her more. Pascal once said that after knowing everything, one returns to ignorance. And I find that after having seen the world and its people, one returns to the novels read during youth. Books still hold the best possibilities; illusions for illusions, they provide more happiness.\r\n\r\nHere's the latest. Bonaparte crossed the Sambre at Thuin and seized Charleroi. There, he found a Prussian regiment who fought back well; there was fighting in the streets. The news arrived in Brussels during a ball given by the Duchess of Richmond. Although everything should have been prepared, no one waited around, not even the Duke. In an instant, the room was deserted: the young people lined up and, from there, left for the war. By midnight, they had all gone. People surrounded the Duke; the aides-de-camps carried his orders. Up and down the stairs, people were whispering and rumours spread. The Duke himself left at three o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nBonaparte has one hundred thousand men. He wanted to separate the English army from the Prussian army. They say that was his play. He has one hundred thousand Prussians in front of him and one hundred thousand Englishmen on his left flank. Plus, there’s fifty thousand Bavarians led by Wrede at Mézières. On 25 March, he knew that he would have to face all the allies at once. He wanted to warn them, so as to give himself the advantage of the attack. Perhaps, he was going to act like Gribouille, who threw himself in the water from fear of the rain, but he doesn't possess that kind of subtlety. He has led very competently since his return, and, in my opinion, he has not put a foot wrong.\r\n\r\nAdieu madame! Please write to me and send your letters to Mme de Jaucourt at the office of Foreign Affairs. Don't tell anyone that I'm here.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about going to Switzerland very soon. And yourself, what are you doing?\r\n\r\nP.S. The last time that I saw the Duke of Wellington, he asked for news of you and charged me with sending a thousand wishes to you. I am very serious about my plan to go to Switzerland that I just mentioned. There, I will see you and it will make me happy. I am very much inclined to enjoy your company; I have admired you for years and wanted to tell you. But I do fear you, and it is not for any reason that you could guess. Some day, we will discuss it, but, in the meantime, think about me and be kind to me. René talks a lot about you. I hope that one day it will be useful for his cause. The little good that has been done here is down to him.\r\n",

                "text": "The British Baker Rifle has been immortalised in the novels and TV-adaptations of Bernard Cornwell’s creation Rifleman Sharpe. Although Sharpe himself is robustly English, his world is peopled with friendly foreigners, such as the unforgettable Westphalian Captain Frederickson, reflecting the multinational nature of Wellington’s army. In the final showdown at Waterloo, Sharpe is thrown together with the legendary Second Light Battalion of the King’s German Legion.\r\n\r\nThese 400-odd men, most of them Hanoverian subjects of George III, were armed with Baker rifles of the type depicted. Throughout the afternoon of Sunday 18th June 1815, when Napoleon faced Wellington at Waterloo, they defended the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte, a vital strongpoint at the centre of the allied line. By the time the Germans were forced to withdraw in the early evening, they had held up the French for so long that Blücher’s Prussians had had time to come up and decide the day.\r\n\r\nThe Baker rifle had a shorter barrel than the infantry musket issued to the regular line battalions, making it easier to use from a prone position or in buildings, such as the farm at La Haye Sainte. It was also far more accurate, enabling the defenders to pick off enemy officers and cavalry at some distance.\r\n",

                "text": "The Battle of Waterloo, which ended Napoleon’s ‘Hundred Days’, has generally been commemorated in this country as a great British victory. Yet Wellington himself admitted to Thomas Creevey on 18 June 1815 that the battle had been ‘a damned nice thing – the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life’. \r\n\r\nThe battle comprised hundreds of minor skirmishes and confrontations but the arrival of the Prussian forces under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, shown here in an anonymous oil painting (1815-1819), was crucial. \r\n\r\nHis 48,000 men played a key role alongside Wellington’s 67,000. In fact more than half of those who fought at Waterloo were German.\r\n\r\nThis justly reflects the notable, but often unremarked, contribution that the German-speaking population of Europe made to Napoleon’s defeat. That began several years previously with the formation of the Sixth Coalition, in which Austria played a leading role, along with Prussia and Russia, and which culminated in the decisive Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. The French forces were pursued back into France and Napoleon abdicated on 11 April 1814. By September 1814 the Congress of Vienna had already begun to shape the future of Europe. Napoleon’s brief return was a hiatus; Waterloo was a postscript.\r\n",

It was a military disaster that left France once again at the mercy of the Allies. Yet the battle lived on in French national memory as a moment of ‘glorious defeat’, encapsulated in the last stand of the Imperial Guard and by the apocryphal words attributed to General Cambronne: ‘The Guard dies but does not surrender’. \r\n\r\nThis 'mot de Cambronne' became famous throughout nineteenth-century France, an image that would be reproduced many times and would inspire new generations through the textbooks of the Third Republic. But 1815 was not a moment for praising Napoleon, with the Bourbons returning to their throne and France craving peace. Political opinion turned violently against him, and journalists, artists and cartoonists, who had been among the first victims of Napoleonic censorship, piled obloquy upon him. The dethroned Emperor cut a sorry figure as he threw himself on the mercy of his most bitter enemy, England, as this anonymous French caricature (The Guard dies but does not surrender, but Bonaparte surrenders and does not die) pithily makes clear.",

                "text": "This telescope is believed to be the one passed to Napoleon during the battle of Waterloo and that made him aware of the imminent arrival of the Prussian army. \r\n\r\nThe late start to the battle, at around midday, and the inability of the French army to break Wellington's combined British, Dutch and German forces meant that this sighting would have all but confirmed defeat to Napoleon.\r\n A supposedly diversionary French assault on Hougoumont farm by Jérôme Bonaparte became transformed into his own costly private battle. Heavy French causalities were also sustained by D'Erlon's corps, who had marched directly at an Allied army which had remained unscathed by earlier cannonades because of their position on the rear slopes of Mont Saint-Jean.\r\n\r\nThe failure of these initial attacks combined with the discipline exercised by Wellington's army proved crucial. Their mettle was particularly apparent in the face of repeated cavalry charges, led bravely if somewhat unclearly by Marshall Ney. By the time the British centre had been weakened and exposed by the  combined infantry and cavalry force, it was too late for the French to take advantage. Napoleon was forced into relocating crucial divisions to try to hold off the Prussian army seen approaching from the east. By the evening the French army was outnumbered and outflanked and Napoleon was defeated on the field of battle for the last time. \r\n\r\nThis research was completed with funding from the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme.\r\n",

                "text": "When Napoleon fled the battlefield on 18 June 1815, he left behind his campaign baggage and travelling carriage. The contents were seized upon by the Allies and many of the objects still adorn museums today. The Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin has Napoleon's hat.\r\n\r\nFew items of clothing enjoy the same iconic status as Napoleon’s hat. At an auction in 2014 one of the last remaining examples allegedly worn by the French Emperor himself was snapped up for a mere 1.9 million Euros; and the image of Germany’s chief tormentor complete with bicorne has been so deeply etched upon the nation’s psyche that this type of hat has become synonymous with its wearer and, in German at least, is usually referred to as a ‘Napoleonshut’.\r\n\r\nThe bicorne was a vital element in the construction of Napoleon’s mythical persona. Unlike the Duke of Wellington who always wore his front to back (‘en colonne’), Napoleon wore his side-to-side in the so-called ‘athwarts’ style (‘en bataille’). Although slightly at odds with historical fact, legend has it that this fashion was unique to Napoleon. Whereas in pre-revolutionary France the embellished ‘en colonne’ bicorne was associated with the aristocratic officer class, Napoleon’s preference for the plain ‘en bataille’ style was seen as symbolising his solidarity with the ordinary rank and file and made him instantly recognisable.\r\n\r\nMeeting Napoleon’s demand for hats was a lucrative business for the Parisian hatmaker Poupard who between 1800 and 1815 supplied him with some 170 bicornes at over 48 Francs each. Yet even in death the former Emperor was inseparable from his ‘petit chapeau’, and one of the four hats that had accompanied him into exile on the island of St. Helena was placed in his coffin.  \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "This letter to the President of the Chamber of Representatives represents one of the stages in the 2nd downfall of the Emperor and in Napoleon’s coming to terms with his situation after Waterloo (or the Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean as Napoleon refers to it). \r\n\r\nHe avoids the word ‘defeat’ and still presents himself - as did the Revolutionary generals of 1792 and 1793 - as defender of the ‘patrie’. But the Revolutionary overtones mingle with imperialism in the letter because Napoleon calls on the Chamber to remain attached to his person. Napoleon’s recourse to two different sources of legitimacy is striking, as is his repeated enumeration of his ministers, which indicates the importance of the Chamber in deciding what will happen next. The letter also reveals that Napoleon stands denuded before the Chamber – he has neither material nor symbolic resources at his disposal. Even the genius and energy that since the Italian campaigns of the 1790s had become synonymous with him have now gone. \r\n\r\nThe letter was addressed to a Chamber unlikely to rally to Napoleon’s cause because it had elected as President a well-known opponent of Bonapartist autocracy, J.D. Lanjuinais (see the entry for 4 June) who had informed Joseph Bonaparte of the Chamber’s hostility the day before (see J.-P. Bertaud, L’Abdication. 21-23 juin 1815, Paris, Flammarion, 2011, p. 27). This perhaps accounts for the Emperor’s decision to send to the Chamber the most important of his most loyal supporters (or supposed loyal – for Fouché is serving other interests). The inclusion of Lucien Bonaparte to represent the Emperor, however, rather inconveniently made the Chamber less well-disposed towards Napoleon as his brother’s presence served as a reminder of the coup d’état of Brumaire (9 November 1799).\r\n\r\nIn fact it was the Chamber which took the initiative, reclaiming sovereignty in the name of the people and thereby separating the future of France from that of Napoleon. The representative Jay made it clear to Lucien that the Emperor’s abdication was needed without delay or the country would run the risk of being ruined.\r\n\r\nClick on 'Further Information' for a transcription and a translation of the letter and the full original entry in French.\r\n",

                "text": "Transcription\r\n\r\n[21 juin 1815]\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Président [Lanjuinais], \r\n\r\nAfter the battles of Ligny [16 June] et Mont St-Jean [Mont-Saint-Jean i.e. Waterloo, 18 June], and after having rallied the army at Avesnes and Philippeville, seen to the defence of the frontier and that of the towns of Laon and Soissons, I have returned to Paris to plan with my ministers the measures needed for the defence of the nation and to reach agreement with the Chambers on all that the salvation of the country requires.\r\n\r\nI have formed a committee made up of the minister of foreign affairs [Caulaincourt], the comte Carnot [Minister of the Interior] and the duc d’Otrante [Fouché, Police] to renew and follow negotiations with the foreign powers in order to learn of their true intentions and to put an end to the war if that can be done in a way that is compatible with the independence and honour of the Nation. But we must be show an entirely united front and I count on the cooperation and the patriotism of the Chambers and on their attachment to my person.\r\n\r\nI am sending to the Chamber as commissioners, Prince Lucien [Bonaparte] and the ministers of Foreign Affairs [Caulaincourt], of War [Davout], of the Interior [Carnot] and of the Police [Fouché] to bring this message and to provide any report or information that the Chamber may desire.\r\n\r\nThe Elysée Palace, 21 June 1815\r\nNapoléon\r\n\r\n« [mentions en surcharge : « N°49 », « 30 », « IV2 », tampon des Archives de l’Assemblée nationale et des Archives de la Chambre des Députés, date]\r\n[21 juin 1815]\r\n\r\nMonsieur le Président [Lanjuinais], \r\nAprès les batailles de Ligny [16 juin] et de mont St-Jean [Mont-Saint-Jean, i.e. Waterloo, 18 juin], et après avoir pourvu au ralliement de l’armée à Avesnes et à Philippeville, à la défense des places frontières et à celles des villes de Laon et de Soissons, je me suis rendu à Paris pour concerter avec mes ministres les mesures de la défense nationale, et m’entendre avec les Chambres sur tout ce qu’exige le Salut de la patrie.\r\n\r\nJ’ai formé un comité du ministre des affaires étrangères [Caulaincourt], du comte de Carnot [Intérieur] et du duc d’Otrante [Fouché, Police générale] pour renouveler et suivre des négociations avec les puissances étrangères, afin de connaître leurs véritables intentions, et de mettre un terme à la guerre si cela est compatible avec l’indépendance et l’honneur de la Nation. Mais la plus grande union est [p. 2] nécessaire, et je compte sur la coopération et le patriotisme des Chambres, et sur leur attachement à ma personne.\r\n\r\nJ’envoie au milieu de la Chambre, comme commissaires, le Prince Lucien [Bonaparte] et les ministres des affaires étrangères [Caulaincourt], de la guerre [Davout], de l’Intérieur [Carnot] et de la Police générale [Fouché], pour porter le présent message, et donner les communications et les renseignemens que la Chambre pourra désirer.\r\n\r\nAu Palais de l’Élysée, le 21 juin 1815.\r\nNapoléon »\r\n\r\nNotice\r\nCette lettre au président de la Chambre des Représentants témoigne de l’une des phases successives de la seconde chute de l’Aigle et des étapes de sa prise de conscience de la situation. Napoléon s’y présente encore comme le rempart de la nation et son stratège, évitant d’écrire le mot « défaite », précisant qu’il est encore actif sur le front, à l’instar des généraux révolutionnaires de 1792 et 1793, rendant compte à l’Assemblée de leur situation et de leurs actes, et en appelant comme eux au « Salut de la patrie », à la « défense nationale ». Mais les accents révolutionnaires voisinent encore le césarisme lorsqu’il en appelle à « la coopération et [au] patriotisme des Chambres, et [à] leur attachement à [sa] personne ». La dualité des registres de légitimité auxquels recourt l’Empereur est ici frappante, de même que la double énumération de ses ministres, qui indique à la Chambre le crédit que Napoléon lui accorde et le caractère décisif du parti qu’elle prendra. Cette lettre n’en démontre pas moins combien l’Empereur est nu, désormais, ne disposant plus des ressources matérielles ni symboliques propres – le génie et l’énergie napoléonien – qui ont été, depuis la Campagne d’Italie, son mystérieux moteur et en fait le modèle par excellence de l’Idéal-Type césariste wébérien.\r\n\r\nLa lettre du 21 juin est cependant adressée à une Chambre peu susceptible d’adhérer à la cause de Napoléon, car elle a élu à sa Présidence un opposant notoire à l’autocratie bonapartiste, J.-D. Lanjuinais. Cette quasi hostilité, dont Lanjuinais a informé Joseph Bonaparte, (le 20 juin, voir .-P. Bertaud, L’Abdication. 21-23 juin 1815, Paris, Flammarion, 2011, p. 27) explique sans doute pourquoi l’Empereur envoie aux Représentants et en groupe les plus importants de ses hommes-liges (ou supposés tels, puisque le jeu d’un Fouché, par exemple, sert d’autres intérêts). L’envoi des ministres (Guerre, Relations extérieures, Police et Intérieur) à la Chambre répond – se soumet ? – à la résolution décidée par celle-ci sur proposition de Lafayette (art. 5, Résolution du 21 juin, Moniteur universel du 22 juin 1815, n°173, p. 711-712, art . 5 ; cité par J.-P. Bertaux, idem, p. 117) à la mi-journée. Lucien accompagne les ministres pour représenter l’Empereur. Mais le choix particulier de Lucien pour paraître dans la Chambre en son nom présente l’inconvénient de rappeler la séance de Saint-Cloud, du 19 brumaire an VIII (9 novembre 1799), dont il fut l’un des artisans principaux, ce qui ne peut qu’indisposer les Représentants et s’avère moins propice à susciter l’« attachement à [la] personne » de Napoléon.\r\n\r\nIl n’est plus temps de congédier les Représentants (Cf. J.-P. Bertaux, idem, p. 122), car ceux-ci ont pris l’initiative : ils ont proclamé la permanence (résolution Lafayette, art. 2), ils entendent communiquer directement, par voie d’affiche, avec les Français, ils se sont ressaisis de la Souveraineté et, pour ainsi dire, du Pouvoir constituant (Sur proposition de Dupin du 15 juin, la Chambre adopte, le 20 juin le principe d’une « commission chargée de coordonner les constitutions avec l’Acte additionnel » (cf. Th. Lentz, Nouvelle histoire du Premier Empire, IV. Les Cent-Jours. 1815, Paris, Fayard, 2010, p. 511), ce qui revient à déclarer la Chambre constituante), en adressant leur décision « aux deux branches de l’autorité représentative » (i.e. la Chambre des Pairs et l’Empereur) (J.-P. Bertaux, id., p. 121). Une commission de Constitution est élue le 28 juin pour réformer la Benjamine ; elle réunit : Bruneau de Beaumetz Delessart, Gineau, Lanjuinais, Lefebvre, Manuel, Poulain-Grandprey, Ramond, Vimar). Les sorts respectifs de la France et de Napoléon se sont séparés sans retour possible. \r\n\r\nLe Représentant Jay, s’adressant à Lucien dans le Palais-Bourbon, demande sans détour l’abdication de l’Empereur en agitant la menace de la déchéance (cf. Th. Lentz, idem, p. 514).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is not a grandiose act of sacrificial immolation as some have read it, but confirmation of the political defeat that followed the military one. Napoleon still desperately tried to save the throne for his son by naming him Emperor under the title Napoleon II. But in declaring his political career to be over and naming his successor in the same sentence, Napoleon seemed unaware that if he no longer had any political power, he was in no position to name a successor. Lanjuinais drew Napoleon’s attention to this fact by offering to pass on to the Chamber merely Napoleon’s ‘wish’ that his son succeed him on the throne.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber, in not creating a regency, was reflecting the views of the liberal Revolutionaries such as Lafayette and Lanjuinais who felt Napoleon had destroyed the values of the Revolution of 1789, but the decision was also to satisfy the Allies, who were on the point of entering Paris and who had demanded Napoleon’s removal. The European Powers had no desire to validate the Usurper’s dynasty by placing his son on the throne.\r\n\r\nA transcription and translation of the letter can be found under Further Information, along with the full original entry in French.\r\n",

May they be sincere in their declarations and really only hold a grudge against my person.\r\nMy political life is over and I declare my son Emperor of the French, under the title Napoleon II.\r\nThe current ministers will form a provisional governing council.

La rhétorique martiale s’y retrouve (« j’avais bravé », « je m’offre en sacrifice ») et comporte les accents déceptifs (« je comptais sur la réunion de tous les efforts, de toutes les volontés, et le concours de toutes les autorités nationales ») du défaut devenu manifeste, le 21 juin, de la Chambre des Représentants qui dispose désormais des Gardes nationaux . Le « Salut public », l’indépendance de la nation, ainsi que la « personne » de Napoléon figurent symétriquement dans les deux textes\r\nLa Déclaration écrite par Lucien sous la dictée de Napoléon à l’Élysée, n’est pas l’acte d’immolation sacrificiel et grandiose qu’on a parfois voulu y lire en suivant le mouvement de l’idolâtrie bonapartiste ; sous le style impérial, la Déclaration constate la défaite politique après la défaite militaire, tout en tentant désespérément de sauver le trône de l’Aiglon : « Ma vie politique est terminée et je proclame mon fils, sous le titre de Napoléon 2, Empereur des Français ».\r\nInscrits dans une même phrase le renoncement de l’Empereur (« Ma vie politique est terminée »…) et la proclamation de son fils (« je proclame mon fils, sous le titre de Napoléon 2, Empereur des Français ») semblent conditionnées l’une à l’autre, alors que le fait de la première proposition emporte le droit de la seconde. Lanjuinais , président de la Chambre des Représentants le signifie directement au déchu lorsque celui-ci lui observe que le décret d’acceptation par la Chambre de son abdication ne fait aucun cas de Napoléon II : « La chambre n’a délibéré que sur le fait précis de l’abdication, je me ferai un devoir de lui rendre compte du vœu de votre majesté pour son fils » .\r\nLa Chambre, en ne créant pas la régence souhaitée exprime autant le sentiment de révolutionnaires libéraux, tels Lafayette ou Lanjuinais, qui tiennent Napoléon pour le fossoyeur des valeurs de 1789, qu’elle ménage les Alliés, près d’entrer dans Paris et qui ont exigé son éviction. Les puissances européennes coalisées ne sauraient valider la pérennité dynastique de l’Usurpateur.\r\n\r\nV.-A. Lanjuinais, Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de J.-D. Lanjuinais\r\n•\tin J.-D. Lanjuinais, Œuvres, Paris, Dondey-Dupré, 1832, t. 1, extr., p. 65-68\r\n« L’empereur voulait faire nommer au fauteuil l’un des quatre présidens de comité du conseil d’état, et de grands efforts furent dirigés dans ce but, mais sans le moindre succès.\r\nAu premier tour de scrutin, Lanjuinais eut 189 suffrages, et Merlin, le candidat de l’empereur, 49.\r\nLes ministres, les conseillers d’état et les hommes dévoués au gouvernement, espérant empêcher la nomination de Lanjuinais, répandirent le bruit que l’empereur de l’accepterait pas.\r\nLeur attente fut trompée ; toutes les voix dissidentes se reportèrent sur lui, et il fut proclamé au milieu des applaudissemens. Dans cette circonstance, Napoléon tint un conseil d’état. Il ne manqua point de flatteurs pour le porter à refuser sa sanction : Regnault de Saint-Jean-d’Angely et l’austère [L.] Carnot lui représentèrent le danger de cette mesure. [L.] Carnot, en particulier, pénétré d’estime pour Lanjuinais, et répondant de sa loyauté, obtint, malgré une forte répugnance, le consentement de Napoléon. Cependant l’empereur balançait encore, [p. 66] et voulait faire dépendre son approbation des réponses que le président élu ferait à certaines questions ; voici leur entretien :\r\n\"NAPOLEON : Eh bien ! monsieur, il ne s’agit plus de tergiverser, il faut répondre à mes questions.\r\nLANJUINAIS : Sire, avec la rapidité de l’éclair, car je ne compose point avec ma conscience.\r\nNAPOLEON : Êtes-vous à moi ?\r\nLANJUINAIS : Je n’ai jamais été à personne, je n’ai appartenu qu’à mon devoir.\r\nNAPOLEON : Vous éludez. Me servirez-vous ?\r\nLANJUINAIS : Oui, Sire, dans la ligne du devoir, vous avez la visibilité.\r\nNAPOLEON : Mais, me haïssez-vous ?\r\nLANJUINAIS : J’ai eu le bonheur de ne haïr jamais personne, d’être bienveillant et bienfaisant quand je l’ai pu, même envers ceux qui m’ont fait tuable à vue pendant dix-huit mois[ ]\".\r\nÀ ces mots Napoléon tend les bras au président élu et l’embrasse. Il envoie ensuite Régnault de Saint-Jean-d’Angely, porter à la chambre son acceptation.\r\nLe rôle passif de président l’empêcha de participer, autrement que par son vote, aux délibérations nobles et sages qui ont mérité à la chambre des représentans la reconnaissance des amis de la liberté [p. 67] et du pays. Il prit seulement part à la discussion de l’adresse, où il fit substituer le mot de héros à celui de grand homme, en faisant observer naïvement, que l’expression de grand homme supposait des vertus dont celle de héros pouvait plus, aisément se passer.\r\nDans la nuit du 21 juin, il assista au comité spécial, tenu aux Tuileries, pour délibérer sur l’abdication provoquée, le matin à la chambre, par MM. Jay et Lafayette, et il appuya la base de délibération posée par Thibaudeau, qu’on sacrifierait tout pour la patrie, excepté la liberté constitutionnelle et l’intégrité du territoire. Ce principe passa à 17 suffrages sur 30. Il appuya aussi la proposition tendant à l’abdication de l’empereur, faite, ensuite par Lafayette, et qui ne fut point adoptée. Le lendemain l’empereur envoya à la chambre son abdication en faveur de son fils. L’abdication fut acceptée par la chambre. Lanjuinais porta le décret aux Tuileries ; et sur l’observation de l’empereur, que cet acte ne mentionnait pas son fils, il dit avec une fermeté respectueuse : \"La chambre n’a délibéré que sur le fait précis de l’abdication, je me ferai un devoir de lui rendre compte du vœu de votre majesté pour son fils.\"\r\nNapoléon comprit cette réponse, et dit qu’il recommandait son fils à la chambre. Peu de jours après les étrangers entrèrent dans Paris, et les portes de la chambre furent occupées militairement. Quatre-vingts représentans repoussés de leur palais se réunirent [p. 68] au domicile de leur président, et signèrent avec lui un procès-verbal constatant la violence qui mettait fin à l’exercice de leurs fonctions ».\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice biographique de J.-D. Lanjuinais\r\nJean-Denis Lanjuinais (1753-1827), Président de la Chambre des Représentants des Cent-Jours, est une figure de proue du libéralisme politique depuis la pré-Révolution jusqu’à la Restauration.\r\nProfesseur de droit canonique à Rennes (Bretagne) avant 1789, il est élu député aux États-Généraux et un orateur actif de la Constituante. Il fonde, en compagnie de Le Chapelier et Glézen, le club breton, matrice de celui des Jacobins. Retourné à ses études durant la Législative, il siège à la Convention, où il s’oppose aux conditions du procès de Louis XVI. Proche des Girondins, il se défend héroïquement lors de leur mise en accusation et partage leur proscription à compter de juin 1793. Rappelé à la Convention après la chute de Robespierre, il est l’un des pères de la Constitution de l’an III (1795). Élu par 74 départements, il siège au Conseil des Anciens jusqu’en 1797. Il devient ensuite professeur de Législation et de Grammaire générale à l’École centrale de Rennes. Il se rapproche des Idéologues et du cercle de Madame de Staël, et se distingue comme un savant respecté (sciences juridiques, morales et politiques, langues orientales).\r\nL’avènement du régime bonapartiste le renvoie à l’opposition politique, malgré la chape dont le Premier consul couvre l’espace politique dès son accession au pouvoir. Lanjuinais approuve certes le 18 brumaire – il s’y résigne –, avec ses amis Idéologues, et il est ensuite nommé sénateur (1800), avec beaucoup d’anciens révolutionnaires (il y retrouve Daunou, Volney, Destutt de Tracy, Grégoire…). Membre (1803) puis commandant (1804) de la Légion d’Honneur, il devient comte d’Empire (1808) et entre à l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1808 ; au titre des Langues orientales). Suivant cette énumération, Lanjuinais pourrait être considéré comme un bénéficiaire du Ier Empire, toutefois il en va tout autrement : en effet, le titre de comte, comme son grade dans la Légion d’Honneur lui sont attribués par des décisions collectives concernant tous les sénateurs, par fournée, et visant plus à conférer une certaine dignité aux institutions impériales qu’à récompenser des fidélités ; quant à son élection à l’Académie, elle n’a pas dépendu du vouloir de Napoléon.\r\nÀ rebours de cela, Lanjuinais s’oppose seul dans le Sénat au consulat décennal (1802 ) et ensuite à l’a proclamation de l’Empire (1804). Sous la coupe de Napoléon Ier, les délibérations des assemblées n’ayant pas pour secours et garantie la publicité des débats, Lanjuinais tourne son énergie dans d’autres directions, savoir les études savantes et la reconstitution d’un enseignement juridique supérieur au sein de l’Académie de Législation ou Collège de Jurisprudence (à Paris, avec Target, Portalis, Malleville, …) dont la création des universités impériales sonne le glas en 1804-1805, débarrassant Napoléon du prurit idéologue. Lanjuinais lit, s’instruit et se forme, écrit beaucoup et mérite ainsi son entrée à l’Académie (1808). \r\nLorsqu’en 1812 la campagne de Russie arrête les progrès de Napoléon et annonce le déclin, Lanjuinais se trouve mêlé (toujours en compagnie de Grégoire, Destutt de Tracy, Volney…) à la conspiration avortée du général Malet (octobre 1812), visant au renversement du régime bonapartiste.\r\nEn 1814, alors que les Alliés ont investi Paris, Lanjuinais est au nombre des soixante-quatre sénateurs (sur cent quarante) qui votent, à l’instigation de Talleyrand, la déchéance de l’Empereur (Lanjuinais appartient à la commission qui rédige l’acte de déchéance et prononce aussi le rejet de la succession dynastique ), la constitution d’un Gouvernement provisoire (3 avril 1814), puis élabore un projet de constitution dite communément « sénatoriale » (du 6 avril), que refuse ensuite Louis XVIII par la déclaration de Saint-Cloud (2 mai).\r\nDurant la première Restauration, Lanjuinais accède à la Chambre des Pairs (4 juin 1814) à raison du fait qu’il n’est pas régicide et qu’il s’est distingué par sa résistance au régime précédent, toutefois il se révèle là-aussi un ardant défenseur des libertés et opposant constant au retour des formes de l’Ancien Régime.\r\nAu retour de Napoléon de l’Île d’Elbe, Lanjuinais se retire et refuse de prêter les serments que ses différents titres et fonctions exigent. L’Empereur n’ayant pas oublié la part prise à sa première chute l’exclut de la nouvelle Chambre des Pairs. Il est en revanche élu par la ville de Paris et le département de la Seine-et-Marne à celle des Représentants qui le porte, le porte largement à sa présidence la 4 juin 1815, contre les candidats impériaux. Quoique Napoléon y soit spontanément hostile, il confirme cette désignation, qui manifeste la défiance, sinon l’adversité de la Chambre des Représentants. Lorsqu’après Waterloo, l’échec militaire entraîne la chute politique, la Chambre des Représentants devient l’organe de la seconde déchéance, Lanjuinais favorise, à la présidence, les menées des libéraux (Lafayette en particulier) contre l’Empereur. L’achèvement des Cents-Jours répète ainsi à la Chambre des Représentants ce qui s’était produit au Sénat en 1814 : la Chambre accepte l’abdication de Napoléon sans admettre la succession de Napoléon II.\r\nDe nouveau pair sous la seconde Restauration, Lanjuinais y poursuit persévéramment l’opposition libérale (spécialement contre l’ultramontanisme) jusqu’à sa mort en 1827.\r\n\r\nRéférences bibliographiques générales\r\n•\tANSON D., Histoire constitutionnelle française.

                "text": "Like so many ballads of the period, this ‘object’ exists in different forms in different places. Composed by an unknown soldier in the wake of the battle, learnt from him by an injured Scot, Jim Shoubridge, and taken back to Falkirk, the song was immediately printed in a chapbook as ‘The Famous Battle of Waterloo’, in nine verses, set to a tune from the Seven Years’ War. A century later it was collected from a Sussex singer’s rendition as the ‘Eighteenth of June’, with three verses and a chorus, to a different tune, and tidied up by Ralph Vaughan Williams.\r\n\r\nUnlike many loyalist domestic productions, it is a song of tragedy and compassion (text given in 'Further Information'). Rather than revelling in victory, these were soldiers articulating the pain and shock of an incredibly violent battle, identifying with the forlorn figure of Napoleon and committing the first-known ‘facts’ of the battle to oral memory – when it began (not with the first deaths, but with their getting up) and ended; how many died (‘sixty thousand brave soldiers’); and, most obviously, the fatal date itself.\r\n\r\nThe later tune is mournful, in a minor key, returning to the same sad phrase in solemn, inexorable repetition. It matches the lyrics beautifully, accentuating the imagined grief of young girls at home, and dramatising ‘the thunder of five hundred cannon’. It is unsurprising that, unlike so many other topical ballads, it survived to be sung two centuries later. The clip in the link below left shows Martin Carthy's interpretation.\r\n",

                "text": "With his armies defeated at Waterloo, Napoleon fled on the road towards Charleroi. Hot in pursuit were the Prussian cavalry, led by Marshal Blücher. When the Prussians seized hold of the Emperor’s campaign baggage they paraded the Emperor’s dress around on a pole in triumph. Alongside the Prussians, a patrol of the 15th Hussars galloped up to Napoleon’s abandoned travelling carriage, from which one intrepid soldier, Corporal Henry Rolfe, lunged in to snatch Napoleon’s cloak; inside one of the pockets he stumbled across this purse. Richly decorated with green embroidery, the fine workmanship and intimate connection to the Emperor ensured the purse was preserved by Rolfe like a relic.\r\n\r\nIts authenticity has recently been corroborated thanks to a chance discovery of the purse’s contents by staff at the Newcastle Discovery Museum. One crumpled note contained a brief obituary of Henry Rolfe who had died in January 1871, recalling his role on Napoleonic battlefields like Vitoria, Toulouse and Waterloo. A second note outlines the later transmission of the artefact from Rolfe’s widow, to a close friend who had supported her in old age, to one Captain James Redmond Gordon, who recorded the purse’s strange provenance from Waterloo into his hands in 1895.\r\n",

W. Angerstein, Captain of the Grenadier Guards. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, Copenhagen, Wellington’s horse from the same time, and thus Marengo's 'rival', is also missing a hoof which became an ink well in Wellington’s Apsley House: not taken by Wellington himself, but by a butler who only revealed what he’d done after Wellington’s death.\r\n\r\nMarengo was a fourteen hands and one inch light grey Barb, a breed of horse that was introduced by the Moors into Spain from Northern Africa, and that resembles the Arabians, known for their speed and endurance. He was taken by Napoleon after the Battle of Aboukir in Egypt in 1799. In the 100 Days, the first mention of him was at Le Caillou on 15 June in the stables of Napoleon’s headquarters on the Genappe road. At the Battle of Waterloo, despite claims that Marengo carried Napoleon throughout, the leader actually spent much of his time either in his carriage or commanding from a collapsible card table. However, Marengo was wounded in the hip during the battle, before being separated from his master. After this it is thought that Marengo, along with a horse named Jaffa, was put aboard a ship with the wounded horses of the Household Brigade cavalry and sent to England where he remained until his death in 1831.\r\n\r\nThis research was completed with funding from the University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Support Scheme.\r\n",

                "text": "The Marengo Mystery\r\n\r\nDespite his status as Napoleon’s ‘favourite’ horse, there is actually very little documentary evidence of Marengo. Searching the registers gives no record of Marengo: in the ‘Registre de l’ équipage’ for ‘Les Cent-Jours’ (Ligny - Quatre-Bas – Waterloo), Marengo is not listed among the seventeen other horses. He was also not listed as a horse that was transferred to another ‘team’ after the defeat at Waterloo. \r\n\r\nResearch by Jill Hamilton concludes that there is no documentary evidence of a ‘Marengo’ in the primary sources in the archives of Paris. Furthermore, in Napoleon’s instructions about his belongings on Elba being brought back to him do not mention a ‘Marengo’: 'Recover from Elba any of my things that are worth sending. I am anxious to have my Corsican horse, if it is not ill, and can be sent back'. \r\n\r\nThe horse he requests here is a Corsican horse, rather than a ‘Barb’ or ‘Arab’, as Marengo is said to have been. This raises the question as to whether Marengo was on Elba with Napoleon in the first place, and if he wasn’t, where he was during Napoleon’s time in exile and until the 15 June 1815. Records show that no Marengo was in the stables on Elba, despite the fact Napoleon did have some personal horses and that there were 48 other carriage horses present. If he really was Napoleon’s ‘favourite horse’, why would he not have been on Elba with him or if he was, why would he not have been requested by Napoleon?\r\n\r\nThere can also be no certainty that the common account of ‘Marengo’ being rescued by Lord Petre is corect. No Lord Petre was listed as serving at Waterloo, on the guest list for the Richmond Ball on 15 June, or as being present as a civilian on the battlefield. If the identity of Marengo’s rescuer is incorrect, the horse’s identity may also be inaccurate. Similarly, it is recorded that the man who rescued Marengo recognised the bee motif on the harness and the imperial ‘N’ branded on his thigh. However, Napoleon’s senior officials would also have had bees on their horses harnesses and all horses of the imperial stables bore the imperial ‘N’ (this is shown clearly on the thigh of ‘Vizir’, another of Napoleon’s horses that has been stuffed and put on display at the Musée de l’Armée in Paris). This could mean therefore that the horse rescued was not actually Marengo: there would, however, have been strong incentives to claim that one was returning to England with Napoleon’s ‘favourite’ as a trophy of war. Moreover, the names of the horses under Napoleon changed: sometimes they had nicknames and sometimes they were named after old, favourite horses. Was Marengo a nickname for Aly or Desiré, the horses ridden at the Battle of Marengo? It is impressive that Marengo should have served Napoleon for 16 years in some of his greatest campaigns (for example he was supposedly ridden all the way to Russia and back in the European campaign, a great feat for one horse). \r\n\r\nWas Marengo really was just one horse?\r\nOutside Britain, Marengo is not the only horse deemed to have been Napoleon’s ‘favourite’. Vizir, a grey Arab starling, born in 1793 was described in a letter from D.W Clarke (Boulogne on Sea) and John Greaves (Staffordshire) in July 1839 as ‘the favourite horse of weapons of Napoleon’. The life span and records of Vizir are broadly the same as those of Marengo, and so cannot refer to a ‘favourite’ from a different period of Napoleon’s life. Vizir may be the French equivalent of Britain’s ‘Marengo’. The letter goes on to say that the French were very attached to Vizir as it was the Emperor’s horse. Nonetheless, the records show he had numerous personal horses. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, Phillipe Osché points out that one cannot be sure if the stuffed horse at the Musée de l’Armée is even Vizir – it would seem that myth not only surrounds Marengo, but Napoleon’s other horses too. Certainly, Marengo does not have anything like the same prominence in France as he does in Britain.\r\nModern records also depict ‘Jaffa’, the other horse brought to England after the Battle of Waterloo, as Napoleon’s ‘favourite’. In an interesting twist, Jaffa remained relatively anonymous in England, and was apparently buried in the grounds of a small estate with a small trunk of coins. In 1965, the owner of the grounds dug up the grave, but no bones or coins were found, just two hooves. It has been hypothesised that the bones might earlier have found their way to London and might be the bones of ‘Marengo’ on display?\r\n\r\nLa Belle, Napoleon’s mount at the Battle of Marengo, is also said to have been his favourite for hunting and was the favourite horse of painters. Paintings may well be responsible for the widely held British perspective that Marengo was the favourite horse, for in most cases Napoleon is depicted astride a grey Arab, very much like the one brought back to London after the Battle of Waterloo, as in Jacques-Louis David’s 1801 painting ‘Napoleon Bonaparte Crossing the Alps’ and James Ward’s 1824 painting entitled ‘Marengo’. Artists who had never even seen Napoleon began to paint him alongside such a horse. Thus through art, Marengo became the symbol for all Napoleon’s horses, leading the British public to believe that he was Napoleon’s only horse. Indeed, it is possible that ‘Marengo’ was actually a British imposition - the name fixed to the horse given so much public attention.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the prominence of Marengo stems from the awareness that Napoleon had great respect for his horse(s). He is recorded saying:  ‘When I lost my way, I was accustomed to throw the reins on his neck, and he always discovered places where I, with all my observation and boasted superior knowledge, could not’. But if the ‘cult of Napoleon’ increased the romanticisation of his horse, the story of Marengo also added to the legend of Napoleon. It is a great story and some of it may be true – but truth is only an incidental component of most great stories!\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\nHamilton, Jill, Marengo: The Myth of Napoleon’s Horse, (London, 2000).

                "text": "Just over a week after Waterloo, Daniel Sykes, a Yorkshire lawyer, businessman and MP for Kingston-upon-Hull, wrote to his sister, Marianne Thornton. Recent events perplexed him: ‘I cannot help … lamenting that thousands upon thousands of human beings should be slaughtered to settle the Question, (to me an indifferent one) who is to be the monarch of France’. \r\n\r\nSykes’s pacifism reflected his humanitarian leanings, but also his religiosity, Marianne’s marriage to the MP Henry Thornton cementing her family’s place in the influential evangelical cousinhood around William Wilberforce. \r\n\r\nSykes’s letter reflects the ambivalence of religious groups across Europe towards the growing cult of the nation. Enlightened humanism died hard, even in conservative Britain: Sykes deplored how patriotism ignored the achievements of ‘Philosophers[,] Legislators and Divines’ worldwide. And while in Britain and across the continent many clergymen acted as pulpit cheerleaders for wartime crusades, others were deeply uncomfortable with the state-driven subordination of spiritual concerns to official needs. \r\n\r\nFor the time being preachers and propagandists hailed Waterloo as a providential victory. But in the decades after 1815, Catholics and Protestants alike came increasingly to reassert their allegiance to a higher power. Sykes was a harbinger of things to come.\r\n",

                "text": "News of Waterloo led to the writing of a whole regiment of songs, of varying quality: this, with words by J Thompson, and to the tune of the ‘Roast Beef of Old England’, is one of the best. \r\n\r\nIts first line presupposes knowledge of the event – ‘You’ve heard of a battle that’s lately been won’ – and immediately turns to managing the news. The troops are brave and British, led by Wellington, rather than, say, a multi-national force of mostly German, Dutch-Belgian and Irish troops, some of whom ran away, led by Wellington and Blücher.\r\n\r\nThe tone is heroic. Though ‘the slaughter was dreadful’ and the singers must ‘tell it with pain’ in verse six, the focus shifts straight away; even the fallen ‘fought like lions’. Greater prominence is given to the spoils – cannon, baggage, eagles – and the prospect of peace. But excessive jingoism is avoided; there is gloating, but no demonisation of the defeated.\r\n\r\nSuch a blustering lyric would fall flat without a well-matched tune. ‘The Roast Beef of Old England’ is perfect: a rousing, traditional drinking song, with a chorus for listeners to join in with. Unusually for a Pitts broadside, the words fit the rhythm exactly: it is likely that this song was a success in London’s public houses at spreading the impression of a great British victory.\r\n",

                "text": "After a swift campaign lasting only ten days, General Lamarque defeated the royalist troops at the battle of Rocheservière on 20 June 1815. While the future of France was being played out on the international scene, Lamarque was tirelessly attempting – on behalf of Napoleon – to end the civil war and reach peace with the royalist commanders of the Vendée, who were not being very cooperative. \r\n\r\nHowever, when news of the battle of Waterloo (18 June) reached the Nantes newspapers on the 26 June, the continued civil war became pointless, especially after the second abdication of Napoleon on 22 June.\r\n\r\nThis is the proclamation of peace which was signed at Cholet on 26 June by Lamarque and General Sapinaud, the head of the Vendée soldiers. Having no fresh news from Paris and only rumours in their place, these two former enemies then joined forces on 3 July, together with another royalist leader, Auguste de La Rochejaquelein, in order to defend France against possible allied invasion – until Lamarque learned of the capitulation of Paris and the French withdrawal to behind the Loire. \r\n\r\nDespite the peace that he negotiated, the royalists did not forgive Lamarque and his name featured on the list of ‘proscrits’ on 24 July 1815.\r\n\r\nClick below for an extended entry in French\r\n",

                "text": "C'est au cours d'une campagne éclair que le général Lamarque va mettre fin à cette guerre civile. Tout va se jouer en une dizaine de jours : les Vendéens ont concentré leur troupe dans le Marais. \r\n\r\nDu côté impérial, malgré un temps exécrable rendant les chemins boueux, Lamarque quitte Nantes le 11, en y laissant toute son artillerie qui le ralentirait. Muni de vivres pour sept jours, il rejoint Travot qui continue à gêner les grands rassemblements vendéens. Le 18 juin, on annonce à Lamarque qu'une escadre anglaise croise au large de l'île d'Yeu. Comme celle-ci ne se montre point menaçante, il la néglige complètement pour attendre les colonnes vendéennes. Ceux-ci ont déjà rétrogradé vers Rocheservière.\r\n\r\nLa journée du 19 juin va être la veillée d'arme d'un affrontement que Lamarque recherche tant pour terminer avec cette guerre civile. Il va profiter de la nouvelle de la victoire de Ligny en Belgique pour électriser ses hommes. Il réunit ses 6.000 hommes à Legé sous une pluie diluvienne et bouscule les Vendéens. Le 20 juin, toujours sous la pluie, il marche sur Rocheservière où l'ennemi s'est massé avec ses 8.000 hommes. Après un combat d'une demi-heure, les Vendéens sont tournés par la Jeune Garde. En tentant de rallier ses troupes, Suzannet trouve la mort et les soldats se dispersent dans les bois. \r\n\r\nLamarque continue d'avancer vers Rocheservière. Les Vendéens de d'Autichamp tiennent solidement le pont qui enjambe la rivière. Lamarque les fixent en faisant croire qu'il sera pris d'assaut et redouble le feu, car ses éclaireurs ont trouvé deux points guéables non gardés des deux côtés du pont. Pris en tenaille, les Vendéens se rendent compte de la manœuvre lorsque la prise en étau est presque achevée. La retraite est ordonnée. La victoire étant complète, Lamarque ordonne à ses colonnes de suspendre le mouvement, laissant s'enfuir les Vendéens dans un grand désordre et certains dirent après coup : « si les Bleus avaient voulu, ils nous auraient tous tués ». \r\n\r\nAu soir de cette victoire, Lamarque ne fanfaronne pas quand il écrit au ministre de la Guerre : « l'aspect d'un champ de bataille où l'on ne voit que des Français déchire l'âme ; je vais poursuivre les Vendéens plus par mes propositions de paix que par mes colonnes ».\r\nQuoique dispersée, l'insurrection n'est pas morte. Mais une occupation méthodique du pays assure le désarmement. Lamarque propose une nouvelle fois la paix car Napoléon a remporté « une victoire complète sur les armées de Blücher et de Wellington ». \r\n\r\nMais le 21 juin, il apprend par le télégraphe de Chappe la défaite de l'Empereur, ce qui ne l'empêche pas de continuer à mettre la pression sur les chefs vendéens. Il échappe le même jour à une tentative d'assassinat.\r\nLe 23 juin, il allait se porter sur Cholet, coeur de l'insurrection, quand les généraux vendéens lui répondent enfin, se rangeant à ses propositions, non sans arrière-pensées. Les chefs ont décidé de ne pas traiter mais seulement gagner du temps, car ils pensent que Napoléon ne résisterait pas longtemps face aux poids des forces des coalisés. Excédé, Lamarque lance un ultimatum : « Tout ce que vous avez demandé est accordé ; tout ce que vous pouvez désirer est accordé ! […] Si vous refusez ce que vous avez demandé, je mettrai le peuple dans la confidence de ces articles et il verra qui veut la guerre ». Les chefs votent alors pour la paix, malgré de graves dissensions.\r\n\r\nMais les Vendéens apprennent, par les journaux de Nantes du 26, la nouvelle de la défaite de Waterloo du 18. Ces événements sont une chance extraordinaire de remettre en cause les préliminaires de paix pour eux. Lamarque va les mettre au pied du mur, en leur renvoyant la responsabilité de la poursuite d'une guerre rendue inutile puisque Napoléon a abdiqué le 22, laissant la possibilité d'un retour de Louis XVIII. \r\n\r\nAprès s'être encore fait tirer l'oreille, les chefs vendéens signent de mauvaise grâce le traité de Cholet le 26 juin. La nouvelle de la paix se répandit avec rapidité et joie.\r\n\r\nCependant, sans nouvelles de Paris, les rumeurs les plus folles courent selon lesquelles les Alliés démembreraient la France. C'est ainsi que le 3 juillet, par un extraordinaire retournement de situation, Sapinaud et Auguste de La Rochejaquelein se réunissent au général Lamarque pour lutter contre l'invasion alliée ! \r\n\r\nMais le même jour est signée la capitulation de Paris. L'armée française se retire derrière la Loire. Le maréchal Davout ordonne à Lamarque d'évacuer la Vendée pour converger vers Tours et se joindre à lui. Il laisse alors la Vendée pacifiée entre les mains des chefs royalistes chargés de maintenir l'ordre. Mais il ne soupçonne pas, que derrière les bonnes manières de ces chefs, ils s'en est fait des ennemis mortels. Ils ne lui pardonneraient jamais cette conclusion hâtive de la paix, après Waterloo et après l'abdication de Napoléon, lorsque tout était consommé. Il s'en rendra compte lorsqu'il verra son nom sur la liste des proscrits du 24 juillet.\r\n",

                "text": "The registers of the Comédie-Française do not just record which plays are performed each night but also provide snippets of information about the political context in which those plays were put on. This page from the registers for the end of June 1815 is a good example of that.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s arrival back in Paris in March 1815 at the start of the 100 days had led to the Comédie-Française closing for 2 nights. The administration had blamed the tiredness and indisposition of the actors but few in Paris would have been fooled. The company had been deeply divided politically during the Revolutionary decade and Napoleon’s return revealed that those wounds had still not entirely healed. The theatre preferred to close and see how the political situation would play out.\r\n\r\nWith the Allies approaching Paris after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, the Comédie-Française once again considered it prudent to batten down the hatches and wait out the storm. The state of siege under which Paris had been placed was the explanation given for cancelling performances at the end of June. The doors were closed from 29th June until 9th July. The theatre only reopened once Louis XVIII had returned to Paris. \r\n\r\nOn 9th July, the register indicates that the troupe had originally intended to perform Molière’s ‘Tartuffe’, a play where the King ensures that the eponymous imposter is unmasked and all ends well. The actors perhaps felt that this would be seen as too political a gesture because they postponed the performance of ‘Tartuffe’ and offered Colin D’Harleville’s less controversial comedy ‘Le Vieux Célebataire’ and Beaumarchais’ ‘Barbier de Séville’ instead. \r\n\r\nThe Opéra-Comique also closed its doors, but the popular boulevard theatres continued to perform during the siege of Paris.\r\n",

                "text": "The Earl of Uxbridge was hit in the knee by a grape shot in one of the last French attacks. In the film Waterloo (1970) his leg is shot off, but in fact the grape shot made a neat hole in his Colpacks: when Lady Charlotte, his wife (who had been married to Wellington's brother before running off with Uxbridge in 1810) visited the battlefield in July, she took away a grape shot of the same diameter as a souvenir. \r\n\r\nThe shot cut the outer hamstring in two, smashed the head of the tibia and filled the ligaments with shards of bone and cartilage. Some aides hoisted Uxbridge into a gig while Sir Horace Seymour rode to Waterloo to prepare John Robert Hume, Wellington’s surgeon, to receive Uxbridge. Not wishing to be seen to take sole responsibility for the decision to amputate, which he thought necessary, Hume persuaded some artillery surgeons to support his opinion. He then removed the limb, first cutting back the flesh and then sawing through the bone. He tied the arteries and dressed the stump.\r\n\r\nUxbridge took the operation with the greatest sang froid and wrote to his wife the next day: 'Dearest Charlotte, Be bold, prepare for misfortune, I have lost my right leg'. She arrived in Brussels on 25 June with their 4 year-old son Clarence, having crossed the Channel in the Prince Regent's yacht, and visited the battlefield on 2 July. Uxbridge wore the stump cover over the wound for many years. \r\n",

                "text": "Lancashire weaver boy Samuel Bamford, later famed as a social reformer, was just seventeen when he heard the news of Waterloo – but already a seasoned poet. This song, ‘The Patriot’s Hymn’, was perhaps his most influential composition: his comrades sung it at meetings, in prison, and on the march to St Peter’s Fields on the day of Peterloo, four years later.\r\n\r\nMost topical songs at the time were parodies – but a lyric was charged with especial political potency when the tune it subverted was ‘God Save The King’. Bamford subtitled this song as having been written on hearing the news of Waterloo – in another poem, he characterised it as the day when ‘freedom fell by Englishmen’. Its impassioned, strident lines (for full text, see 'Further Information'), calling for freedom and liberty, represent a real heart’s cry: there is no humour here in the use of the tune, only anger and resolve.\r\n\r\nVerse three in particular is a visceral response to the battle. ‘Bleeding promiscuously, / Victors and vanquish’d lie, / Mingled in butchery’. Bamford’s Christian radicalism is here to the fore, and the lines conjure up a battle won by tyrants at the expense of a fraternity of man. Sung en masse, it still has the power to stir.\r\n",

                "text": "This is an allegory of Napoleon’s radiance by Adam Victor (1801-1866), dated to the July Monarchy. The statue in the middle represents Napoleon Bonaparte, standing on the top of the Vendôme Column. On a rainbow we can recognize the main topics which make up the Napoleonic legend, with illustrations of different stages of Napoleon’s life including the troops crossing the St Bernard pass,  Austerlitz, Napoleon ranging a canon, and Waterloo. Under the statue is drawn the Legion of honour. \r\n\r\n\tThe quote chosen to reinforce the glorious image conveyed by the engraving is from a poem entitled ‘A Napoleon’ (To Napoleon) by the poet and playwright Casimir Delavigne (1793-1843) : \r\n\r\n‘Ton souffle du chaos faisait sortir les lois ; \r\nTon image insultait aux dépouilles des rois. \r\nEt, debout sur l'airain de leurs foudres guerrières, \r\nEntretenait le ciel du bruit de tes exploits’ \r\n\r\n(Your breath from the chaos made the laws come out; / Your image insulted the Kings’ remains. / And, standing on the bronze of their warriors’ lightning, / Spoke to the sky about the echo of your exploits.’) \r\n\r\nIn 1815, Delavigne was only 22 years old, he was not yet famous but the 100 days probably helped his poetical project to mature, especially in the case of les Messéniennes (1818). Delavigne was interested in what Napoleon embodied, by his figure as a leader behind whom the French people could gather. This fits the conception Delavigne had of the Poet’s mission which was, according to him, to unify the French people.\r\n",

                "text": "The ‘Antipodes de Paris’ \r\n\r\nOn 3 July 1815, the French defence of Paris was overcome by the Prussians at the Battle of Issy, leading the Conseil de Défense to surrender. As the forces of the Seventh Coalition prepared to reconquer the capital, Louis XVIII gathered a Cabinet topographique du Roi and commissioned Pierre Lapie, a commercial map-maker for the Bastien and Langlois manufactures, to chart this reversal of power in a terrestrial globe. This piece aimed to represent, allegorically as much as scientifically, the ‘antipodes of Paris’. Dedicated to the Duchesse d’Angoulême, the only living child of Marie-Antoinette and Louis XVI, this globe solemnised the re-establishment of the Bourbon succession.\r\n\r\nThe geographical details offer evidence of the political nature of this object: France was depicted within the lines of its former pré carré, and the trajectories of four ancien regime explorers were shown, such as those of Columbus in 1492-1493 and those of Bougainville in 1768-1769. Yet, what appears intriguing is that, as a token of monarchical loyalism, this globe syncretised a residual symbolism of the Napoleonic conquests with aspirations to restore an exiled vision of the world. This is particularly evident in the choice of Egyptian columns to uphold the globe’s table. The depiction of Tasmania, as an island, was also up-to-date and informed by both Flinders’ discoveries and Baudin and Freycinet’s map of the Australian coastline published in 1811, which suggests the ambivalent nature of the information and symbols mobilised in this piece. This melange was partly owing to the fact Pierre Lapie had developed his trade under Napoleon, and sold his globes as elegant ornaments to the French imperial elites before serving the Bourbons in their attempt to refashion themselves in time and space after Waterloo. \r\n\r\nOverall, this ambiguous globe is a powerful testament that geography developed in close affinity with state-formation during the period, and that its purpose was to address political as much as scientific and commercial interests.\r\n",

                "text": "Napoleon attempted to put some distance between himself and the advancing allies by leaving for the port of Rochefort on 30 June. It was there, he hoped, that two frigates would be waiting to whisk him away to America. \r\n\r\nA second group of followers, made up of General Montholon and the Count de Las Cases, chamberlain, took a different route. It was on this journey that Las Cases began his daily journal, passages from which would later on form the celebrated Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène, a text that brought posthumous glory to the fallen emperor. \r\n\r\nWhen they were recognised as members of Napoleon’s travelling party, they met with different reactions depending upon the place. Sometimes there was ambivalence, at others there was downright hostility. Las Cases noted, for example, the hostility of the small town of Saintes. An angry mob shouted insults at the travellers, calling them ‘scélérats’ (‘blackguards’). The National Guard was forced to intervene to prevent bodily harm. Las Cases referred to his would-be attackers as ‘populace’ or ‘rabble’, despite the fact that most of those gesticulating were actually men, and above all women, of the town elite. \r\n\r\nThe arrival of some country-folk and some “fédérés” changed the mood of the gathering, and it was to the accompaniment of the good wishes of the new crowd that the party set off again. These people Las Cases calls ‘le peuple’ or ‘the people’, a word with a noble ring to it. Nor is this anecdotal. The chequerboard ‘for-and-against’ nature of the reaction of people on the way was mirrored on Napoleon’s journey too, and this gives a snapshot of public opinion during Napoleon’s second fall. Whilst both country and town shared the same longing for peace, nevertheless urban dwellers had been harder hit by the Continental Blockade and saw Napoleon as an obstacle to peace, whereas country dwellers had seen prices and salaries rise in the agricultural sector. And the country had always been more appreciative of the return of religion and was more attached to the father figure who had brought glory to, and pride in, the victorious nation. \r\n\r\nTo read the entry in French, see Further Information",

                "text": "Fuyant l’avancée des Alliés sur Paris, Napoléon se mit en route le 30 juin vers le port de Rochefort où l’attendaient deux frégates mises à disposition pour atteindre, pensait-il, l’Amérique. Une seconde colonne de fidèles, composé entre autres du général Montholon et le Comte de Las Cases, chambellan, prit un itinéraire différent. Dans ces derniers jours en terre française, Emmanuel de Las Cases commença à tenir son journal d’exil, futur matériau pour le Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène. Las Cases relate l’hostilité des habitants de la petite ville de Saintes. Une foule agitée, nerveuse injuria les voyageurs et les traita de scélérats. Las Cases utilise le mot péjoratif de populace, bien qu’il note qu’elle était essentiellement constituée d’hommes et surtout de femmes de la classe distinguée de la ville. L’arrivée de paysans et de « fédérés » changea les esprits et ce furent sous les acclamations que la petite troupe continua son périple. Au-delà de l’anecdote, ces péripéties illustrent l’état d’esprit de la population lors de la seconde chute de Napoléon. Si les habitants des villes et des campagnes partageaient le même désir de mettre fin aux guerres, l’adhésion au régime impérial et à la personne de Napoléon connut deux déclinaisons différentes. Elle s’était effondrée dans la population urbaine qui fut durement touchée par les conséquences négatives du Blocus continental et qui considérait l’empereur comme un obstacle à une paix durable et au retour des affaires. A l’opposé l’Empire fut une période de hausse des prix et des salaires dans l’agriculture. De plus, le monde rural avait été sensible au rétablissement de la religion et restait profondément attaché à un état personnalisé par une figure paternelle, qui leur avait fait ressentir la gloire et la fierté d’appartenir à une nation victorieuse.",

The regiment had marched hard for two days and taken up position at the left centre of Wellington’s line. Exposed to small arms and ordnance fire, it took severe punishment, suffering 478 casualties out of 698 men (68%). The dead were observed lying still in square formation after the action. There exists, on the battlefield, a memorial to this brave battalion.\r\n\r\nCaptain Holmes was struck in the back of his upper chest. The small lead ball entered his thorax and caused death by bleeding and air leak. His wife, as a memento mori, had his body macerated (boiled) and the damaged vertebra extracted, dried and varnished; a silver container, with a display of arms and the word ‘Waterloo’ inscribed on the lid, and containing the missile, was set within the bone. The bone itself was presented in a red Moroccan leather case. A somewhat macabre souvenir of her husband and the battle, it must remain as one of the strangest artefacts of this important event.\r\n",

The Governor, the comte de Vaugiraud, relying on the pro-British plantation owners, immediately allied himself with the British authorities. He dissolved a large part of the army, leaving the way open to the British, who took control of the island without a struggle.\r\n\r\nIn Guadeloupe, on the other hand, the population, which had been through so many revolutionary upheavals, was affected by a sentiment of opposition towards the British, who had occupied the island between 1810 and 1815. The governor de Linois declared support for Napoleon and vigorously held off British advances who wanted to take the island for Louis XVIII. \r\n\r\nOn 23rd March 1815, the King had promoted the Governor of Martinique to become Governor General with authority over Guadeloupe. In light of this promotion, he wrote the proclamation published here, announcing that he was dismissing all the civil and military authorities on the island who had sworn allegiance to Napoleon. He knew he could rely on the plantation owners returning from exile to support him. \r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the Guadeloupe authorities chose to publish Vaugirard’s royalist proclamation but it had already been widely disseminated in royalist circles. The authorities of Guadeloupe chose to publish it in order to be able to respond to it with their own proclamation, in Napoleon’s name, which forced the inhabitants to declare themselves for or against the Emperor. \r\n\r\nTo read the full, original article in French, click on Further Information\r\n",

Cependant, comme en Guadeloupe, l’armée est largement favorable à l’empereur et prête à le suivre dans la restauration de l’empire. \r\n\tLa Martinique qui avait été anglaise de 1794 à 1802 avait expérimenté le système colonial britannique qui avait maintenu et même renforcé le système d’exploitation basé sur l’économie de plantation et l’esclavage au profit de la bourgeoisie locale.\r\n\tEn Guadeloupe, au contraire, la tourmente révolutionnaire depuis l’abolition de l’esclavage en 1794, l’émigration des élites, l’organisation de la course contre les navires britanniques et américains, la sédition de l’armée coloniale et la reconquête de l’île par le corps expéditionnaire dirigé par Richepance, avaient créé une mentalité très différente. \r\n\tLe rétablissement de l’esclavage en 1802, le retour des propriétaires émigrés, ruinés et contraints de cohabiter avec les « petits blancs » qui avaient acquis des moyens financiers importants, n’avaient pas « restauré » la société d’Ancien Régime. La population issue de ces bouleversements était parcourue par un sentiment d’indépendance et d’aversion envers les britanniques. \r\n\tC’est cette population qui a dû subir, à son corps défendant, l’occupation anglaise de 1810 à 1815. \r\n\r\n\tCe passé récent donne les clefs de l’attitude différente adoptée par les deux îles lors de l’annonce du retour en France de Napoléon Bonaparte.\r\n\tEn Martinique, le gouverneur, s’appuyant sur les planteurs pro-britanniques, se rapprocha immédiatement des autorités anglaises présentes dans la zone afin de manœuvrer pour mettre l’île sous leur protection. Face à l’opposition qu’il connaissait dans l’armée, il en fit partir la plus grande partie, laissant la voie libre aux troupes britanniques qui prirent possession de l’île sans combat.\r\n\tEn Guadeloupe, le gouverneur de Linois, après de longues hésitations, poussé par son second, Boyer-Peyreleau, fermement bonapartiste et par la plus grande partie de la troupe, se déclara finalement pour Bonaparte. Il repoussa fermement les avances britanniques qui lui proposaient de réinvestir la colonie pour la conserver au roi de France. \r\n\r\n\tFace à cette situation contrastée, par son ordonnance du 23 mars 1815, le roi nomma le gouverneur de la Martinique, gouverneur général avec autorité sur la Guadeloupe, titre que l’on retrouve dans la titulature annoncée ainsi que dans le 1er paragraphe.\r\n\tEn vertu de ces pouvoirs, il annonçait qu’il destituait toutes les autorités civiles et militaires qui avaient prêté serment à Napoléon et tentait de les priver de leurs ressources financières. \r\n\tNous avons également la confirmation de la désertion d’officiers et de militaires de la Martinique qui ont rejoint l’île sœur. Et ceux-ci sont particulièrement visés. \r\n\tIl sait qu’il peut compter sur les planteurs de retour d’émigration et qui ne veulent surtout pas entrer dans une nouvelle phase d’incertitude. \r\n\t\r\n\tOn peut se demander la raison pour laquelle les autorités de la Guadeloupe ont favorisé la publication de cette proclamation qui leur est défavorable. C’est qu’elle s’était déjà répandue dans les milieux royalistes et c’était l’occasion de répondre en mettant en exergue le fait que M. de Vaugiraud s’appuyait sur les Anglais, attitude généralement honnie par la partie la plus entreprenante de la population guadeloupéenne. \r\n\tD’ailleurs, le gouverneur de Linois (ou ses proches) a fait suivre cette publication de sa propre proclamation tendant à obliger les habitants à se déterminer pour ou contre l’empereur. \r\n\r\n\tCes proclamations furent rédigées le 29 juin 1815 alors que la bataille de Waterloo avait déjà eu lieu (18 juin 1815), mais dont la nouvelle n’était pas encore parvenue aux Antilles. \r\n",

This route thus links the Genevan basin to the plains of Lyon and was regularly the scene of skirmishes between the Austrians and the French. In March 1814 the General Bardet, devoid of his artillery, had thrown rocks down on the Austrian garrison to seize the fort. By the end of the campaign, however, the Austrians had regained control of the fort and when they left the area, they took care to leave the fort in ruins so as to keep their route into France open. During the 100 days, Napoleon named Villetard de la Guérie as the commanding officer. Guérie got straight down to business renovating the fortifications then ensured he had the provisions to withstand a siege with his veterans and members of the National Guard. At the beginning of July 1815, four Austrian columns of soldiers left Geneva. Under the orders of Chevrier, one of them presented itself before the Fort de l’Ecluse with its artillery on 5th July. The French resistance was fierce until a shell set a warehouse of gunpowder on fire. Villetard de la Guérie, having lost thirty-two men, honourably surrendered his arms.\r\n\r\nTo read the original article in French, click Further Information",

Cette route permet ainsi de relier le bassin genevois aux plaines lyonnaises ; c’est pourquoi le pays de Gex est le théâtre de nombreux combats entre Autrichiens et troupes ou corps francs français. Le 1er mars 1814, à la tête de 200 hommes environ, le général Bardet, dépourvu d’artillerie, fait chuter des rochers sur la garnison autrichienne pour s’emparer du fort. A l’issue des combats de la campagne, les Autrichiens sont toutefois maîtres de la place. En évacuant le pays, ils prennent soin de réduire le fort à l’état de ruine afin de se laisser ouverte la route de Lyon. Au début des Cent-Jours, la mobilisation patriotique est forte dans l’Ain, département réputé républicain. Après le décret du 22 avril 1815 sur la constitution des corps francs, le colonel Béatrix de Collonges prend leur tête dans l’Ain. La garde nationale accueille également de nombreux volontaires. A partir du 26 juin, une partie des 26 000 Autrichiens réunis à Genève sous les ordres du général Frimont doit prendre le contrôle du pays de Gex et de tout le département de l’Ain. Dès le lendemain, les premières escarmouches opposent les corps francs à des détachements autrichiens dans le pays de Gex. Depuis le 18 mai, le chef de bataillon Villetard de la Guérie est investi du commandement du fort de l’Ecluse. Il s’est attelé à la remise en état des fortifications puis prévoit de quoi soutenir un siège avec ses vétérans et gardes nationaux. Il sait également pouvoir compter sur le soutien des corps francs qui tiennent les hauteurs. Au début du mois de juillet, quatre colonnes autrichiennes partent de Genève. Leur mouvement a pour but de cerner les effectifs des partisans éparpillés sur toutes les montagnes environnantes. Sous les ordres de Chevrier, l’une des colonnes autrichiennes se présente devant le Fort de l’Ecluse le 5 juillet. La résistance française est acharnée. Les Autrichiens décident de tirer leur canon à la main jusqu’au mont Vuache qui surplombe le fort. Ouvrant le feu depuis cette hauteur, ils provoquent un incendie dans le magasin de poudre. Une partie des murs s’est également écroulée. Avec une perte de 32 hommes, Villetard de la Guérie rend finalement les armes.\r\n\r\nSources : A.D.

                "text": "In April 1815, a young Englishman, John Cam Hobhouse, later to become the politician, the 1st Baron Broughton (1786 – 1869), travelled to Paris where he became an eyewitness to the historic series of events unfolding in the French capital.  The young Hobhouse was besotted with the ideal of Napoleon as the worthy Emperor of the French, and he was determined both to witness and describe the events as they unfolded. His letters sent home to England were far from casual and informal – more a deliberate attempt to write a piece of contemporary history in the epistolary style. Indeed, Hobhouse’s Letters from Paris was published in 1816, providing a detailed description of the social and political upheaval in Paris.   \r\n \r\nHobhouse’s letter of 8th July 1815 recounts the Allies' entry into Paris following Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo and the return of Louis XVIII on 8th July.\r\n \r\n“The Duke of Wellington, and the whole English army, behave with a moderation more noble than their victory. The sovereigns promise solemnly to adhere to their declarations. The friends of freedom cherish every hope. Lord Castlereagh arrives; the curtain rises at once, and displays the triumphant personages of the drama, unmasked, and in the attitude of revenge and rage; whilst France appears, a conquered culprit, in chains, bound to the altar, and waiting for the blow. Her government is dissolved by force; her representatives are driven from their seats; the glittering ensigns of her former glory are town down, and displaced by the banner of treason and disgrace, the pale memorial of defeat and slavery.”\r\n\r\nHobhouse’s use of theatrical metaphor is striking here – and represents a more general tendency to view the 100 Days in dramatic terms.",

                "text": "Henry William Paget, Earl of Uxbridge, was made Marquess of Anglesey following his distinguished role at Waterloo. On the morning of the battle he declared, ‘We shall have sharp work today’. They did indeed. As commander of the heavy cavalry at a key point in the battle he led a successful charge routing 15,000 French infantry. Unfortunately, the cavalry failed to re-group after its initial success, leaving it vulnerable to attack from the French cavalry which decimated their ranks. Uxbridge blamed himself for the failure, believing that he would have been able to exercise better control if he had charged with the second rank. \r\n\r\nFor the rest of the battle he spent his time encouraging the light brigades. He was lucky to survive for he had eight or nine horses shot from under him. Towards the end of the battle, at Wellington’s side, Uxbridge was hit by grapeshot in his right knee. It is said that he exclaimed ‘By God, sir, I've lost my leg!’ and that Wellington replied, ‘By God, sir, so you have! That night, the leg was amputated. Uxbridge was calm throughout, and the following day, with typical phlegm, he declared to the Marquise d’Asshe, ‘Well Marquise, you see I shan’t be able to dance with you again except with a wooden leg.’ \r\n\r\nHis wooden leg, or rather wooden legs, were far different from existing wooden legs known as ‘clappers’ for the noise they made. He had made for himself the first articulated artificial limb ever devised—the ‘Anglesey leg’, and he had different legs made for different activities – he had a leg for walking and a leg for riding. That shown (in the museum at Plas Newydd, Anglesey), is an Anglesey leg of c. 1830 – patented by James Potts of Chelsea in 1828 – which even in his sixties enabled the Marquess to walk miles a day.",

                "text": "Current affairs were generally subject to musical satire (as in the French vaudevilles shown on 12 April and 13 May) and Waterloo, even with its tragic loss of life, was no different. One light-hearted South German response to the battle was simply titled a 'Komisches Jubellied', a comic celebration song. \r\n\r\nThe words were written to a tune from a smash-hit Singspiel – that is, a popular German language-opera – that premiered in 1793 in Vienna: Das neue Sonntagskind. A drinking song in the opera, 'Wer niemals einem Rausch gehabt', the number was quickly extracted from its stage setting to become a popular drinking song offstage too.\r\n\r\nThe text written for the tune in 1815 (given and translated in 'Further Information') recounts the final defeat of Napoleon through the main protagonists  - Napoleon, Wellington and Blücher - with the Emperor referred to by a number of titles that both emphasise and make light of the threat he had posed to Germans over the last 15 years: 'ogre' ('Menschenfresser'), 'my good Bartel', the 'almighty emperor', the 'proud pharaoh'. This irreverence extends to the humourous, sometimes scatological, tone of the song: Napoleon not only gets his nose burnt by Wellington, but his flight from the allies apparently caused him to defecate with fright. \r\n\r\nThe language is similarly informal, making use of a number of Southern idioms that are difficult to translate now: the somewhat obscure last 2 lines, translated roughly as 'Soon we’ll celebrate the peace-feast/ Good riddance to it all', suggest that the tune had retained its function as a drinking song.\r\n",

Everyone joins in gladly <br />With joyful roundelay <br />Bonaparte will never again<br /> Be the ogre <br />Gone is all his fun <br />Now it’s quite another story. <br /><br />He had scarcely arrived under good wind <br />And come back home to France <br />When immediately almost all the riff-raff <br />Dashed back to him once again; <br />And all exclaimed in one voice <br />Long live Napoleon! <br /><br />My good Bartel was not lazy <br />He did again what he could, <br />Gave the French false hope again <br />And everybody followed him; <br />He set off in high splendour <br />Against the Allies. <br /><br />But this time, a thousand Zounds, <br />Mr. Napoleon got <br />His long nose properly burnt <br />By Duke of Wellington; <br />Who gave him hell <br />Like at the burning of Moscow. <br /><br />Then Marshall Vorwärts [Blücher] arrived; <br />Then it only went worse for him <br />In wholly Prussian fashion the former <br />Finished him off; <br />Then he fled over hill and dale <br />As if the devil were coming along behind. <br /><br />So fled at once our hero, <br />And didn’t ever look behind; <br />And in the rich field of deeds <br />Forsook all and sundry <br />Had you seen his trousers <br />Certainly he would have left his mark. <br /><br />Now the dance was over at once, <br />Since all jumped and ran; <br />His eagle turned into the mouse <br />And the wings drooped; <br />How badly things went amiss, <br />O you Almighty Emperor, you! <br /><br />So it is once again all up with you, <br />You proud Pharaoh! <br />Even the devil himself is pleased- and we <br />Are all heartily glad; <br />Soon we’ll celebrate the peace-feast <br />Good riddance to it all.",

It reflects changes in political power during the early 19th century, leading up to the Restoration of the French monarchy. Someone has written on the sheet in ink, removing references to the French Revolution and to Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821). On the Arc de Triomphe, fleurs–de-lis (the symbol of the Bourbon monarchy) cover up an angel and an imperial crown. \r\n\r\nThe triumphal arch had been commissioned by Napoleon in 1806, but construction was halted by the Restoration of Louis XVIII (1755-1824) and only resumed in 1833 and 1836, during the reign of King-Louis Philippe (1773-1850). \r\n\r\nThis game and its manuscript amendments highlight the importance of the Napoleonic symbol and how meaning was adapted to changing circumstances even in moments of play.\r\n",

With Louis XVIII's return to Paris he left for Riom on 12th July. His name was on a list of those condemned for betraying the King published on 24th July,  which meant he needed to leave the country. However, he first returned to Paris in early August to see his young family one last time. He was recognised, denounced and arrested. \r\n\r\nDespite the protection of Fouché and Constant, La Bédoyère  was court-marshalled and sentenced to death on 15th August 1815.  He was executed on 19th August 1815 and was buried at the Père-Lachaise cemetery. \r\n\r\nHis tomb reflects his family’s commitment to the French military and the Napoleonic imaginary.\r\n",

Bellerophon; with a detail of the principal events that occurred in that ship between the 24th May and the 8th of August, 1815’, the captain of the Bellerophon, Frederick Maitland, details how he had received orders at the end of May 1815 to support the uprising in the Vendée and to detain and send to port any French armed vessel.  The British were keen in particular to ensure that no ship carrying pro-Bonaparte messages should set sail for the Caribbean. \r\n\r\nThe Bellerophon patrolled the area outside the port of Rochefort from early June. Maitland did not learn of the victory at Waterloo until 28th June, and received word from Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Hotham on 6th July that Napoleon was considering leaving for America from Rochefort . He was enjoined to use his ‘best endeavours to prevent him from making his escape’. \r\n\r\nThe chart which is shown here appeared in Maitland’s published account of the events of 1815. It shows how he tried to cover the exits to Rochefort with the limited resources available to him, fully expecting Napoleon to try to evade capture. By 13th July, Maitland could see that the French frigates the Méduse and the Saale were preparing for a sea voyage because they were taking on board vegetables. On 14th July at daybreak, however, the French schooner the Mouche approached bearing the flag of truce...\r\n",

                "text": "These pages come from the Midshipman’s Log of Francis Wall Justice who served aboard HMS Bellerophon, also known as the “Billy Ruffian”, a 74-gun ship of the line on blockade duty off the coast of France. Midshipmens’ logs were journals of quotidian events and could be compared to the black boxes now carried by so many modes of transport as a means of record. \r\n\r\nJuly 14, 1815 was a busy day for those aboard Bellerophon. Norman Mackenzie, author of Fallen Eagle, describes some of the challenges:  \r\n\r\nAs Bellerophon had been cleared for action in this uncertain period when she might have to engage the [French] frigates, cabins had to be set up again and furnished as far as possible—starting with the makeover of [Captain F.L.] Maitland’s fine stern cabin for Napoleon.  The protocol as well as the practical problems were great.  The cabins were graded by rank; how should they be graded for the five generals?  Where were the footmen and the cooks to be put?  And what was to be done, on a ship already crowded with over 500 men, about a dozen maids? ... There had been some extraordinary sights on the Billy Ruffian over the years, but the hustle and bustle to get all these arrangements made must have been quite remarkable, a splendid test of the Royal Navy’s capacity to fit-as-fit-may at short notice.  Maitland would have been pleased with the way his officers and men accomplished such a transformation, as if they were engaged to produce some sort of nautical pantomime. (2009, pp. 146/7)\r\n\r\n",

In an atmosphere of silent expectation and some apprehension on Captain Maitland’s part, a party of marines was assembled to greet the “Corsican Ogre.”  Dressed with extreme care and wearing his bicorn adorned with a tricolour cockade, Napoleon was piped aboard—the bosun’s whistle the only sound to break the silence.  Napoleon doffed his hat and greeted Maitland with the words; “I am come to throw myself on the protection of your prince and laws.”   Norman Mackenzie takes up the story:\r\nAfter the rest of his suite had come aboard, and introductions had eased the inevitable embarrassment of the moment, Maitland was glad to take up Napoleon’s request to be shown over the ship, a custom often observed on such occasions.  There was the usual run of small talk and an agreeable social tone was picked up by the officers, each astonished by the presence of the emperor relaxing in the courtesy of their deck. “From the time of his first coming on board my ship,” Maitland reflected, “to the period of his quitting her, his conduct was invariably that of a gentleman.” Such a testimonial explains the unexpectedly comfortable way a ship’s company and its extraordinary passengers were to pass their days together. (Adapted from pp.156/7) ... All the letters and diaries that survive give a surprisingly agreeable impression of a voyage which might easily have been intolerable.  One officer described the voyage as ‘halcyon days.’ (p. 148)\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n\r\nMacKenzie, N. (2009). Fallen Eagle: How the Royal Navy Captured Napoleon.

                "text": "By the middle of July, 1815, a flotilla of Royal Navy warships were blockading the ports along French Atlantic coastline with firm orders to prevent Napoleon making his escape. A point came in negotiations with the Royal Navy when Napoleon realised that he could neither remain any longer in France nor hope to escape from France by running the gauntlet of British Naval vessels. Holed up in a house on Ile d’Aix, from 12 to 15 July, he eventually realised the impossibility of accomplishing his plan to get to America, and so in the end he decided to throw himself on the mercy of the British.  He wrote a letter to George, the Prince Regent, dated 13 July 1815, in which he begged to be granted refuge in Britain from his many enemies. It was a letter in which he firmly declared “My political career has come to an end”. \r\nOnce on board HMS Bellerophon he voluntarily surrendered to Captain Maitland, who then took Napoleon to Plymouth Sound, to await further orders.\r\n\r\nThis engraving, published in Leeds in 1817, is a very rare impression of the historic scene. The naval costumes, the ship’s rigging, and even the appearance of the leading players are all reasonably accurate, but of course they are all imaginary. Midshipman George Home, who wrote an account of Napoleon's arrival on board which is quoted at length in the book Bellerophon \"The \r\nbravest of the Brave\" by Edward Fraser (published in 1909), says that Napoleon was \"without any sword\" (Fraser, p. 277). The engraver has taken the liberty of adding one for dramatic effect.",

                "text": "On July 15th, Napoleon surrendered on board HMS Bellerophon just off Rochefort, bringing the Hundred Days to an end. Two vestiges of that historic ship survive. The first is a fragment of the masthead depicting the Greek hero Bellerophon, nicknamed by the crew ‘Billy Ruffian’; the second is a pair of muscular carvings of the Greek god Atlas which adorned the stern of the ship. \r\n\r\nBoth would have originally been created by the firm Graves of Frindsbury in 1786, when Bellerophon was launched as a third-rate, 74 gun ship. She went on to serve with distinction at major naval engagements such as the Glorious First (1794), the Nile (1798) and Trafalgar (1805).\r\n\r\nThis veteran warship transported Napoleon to Britain, en route for his later transfer to St Helena. After 1815 the ship became a prison hulk before eventually being sold and broken up in 1836. Fortunately, the former captain of the Bellerophon, Sir Frederick Maitland, purchased the carvings and placed them in a mould-loft at Portsmouth dockyard. \r\n\r\nThis conservation gesture was only partially successful, as much of the original composition - which had featured Bellerophon riding Pegasus with his cloak flying behind him, brandishing a javelin in his hand - subsequently decayed.\r\n",

The long boat is shown on the beams (on the port side) loaded with casks ready to go ashore to fetch fresh water.\r\n\r\n• The Captain’s barge is also on the beams (starboard side) always ready in case the Captain required its services.\r\n\r\n• The cutter, on the port side in the davits (note the swivel guns) is ready to take on Marines who would intercept any small boat approaching Bellerophon.\r\n\r\n(Information courtesy of Alison Mercer, Assistant Curator, Naval Museum of Alberta)\r\n\r\nOf interest\r\n\r\nThe model shows HMS Bellerophon unrigged.  Ships being maintained, repaired or held in reserve were placed “in ordinary”, that is to say, without masts or rigging.  When called into action, it took only two and a half weeks to rig a ship of this size to ready her according to Admiralty Orders, for sea, battle or other duties. \r\n\r\n",

                "text": "On the 18th of July 1815, two plays, The Poor Gentleman by George Colman the Younger (1802) and Raising the Wind by James Kenney (1803), were performed before Napoleon Buonaparte on board HMS Bellerophon.  \r\n\r\nAfter his defeat at Waterloo, the former Emperor had decided that his best course of action was to ask “generous” England to provide him with land so that he might retire to the countryside and become a gentleman farmer. In pursuit of that plan, Napoleon had surrendered his sword three days earlier on the 15th of July, to Frederick Lewis Maitland, Captain of Bellerophon.  It is against a setting of the back and forth of urgent signals from sea and pressing messages to London requesting orders as to how to proceed that these plays were staged.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the discrepancy in dates \r\nReaders will note that the date on the playbill reads, “On                Evening, the          \tof September, 1815, will be presented the Comedy of      ”.  From this we may surmise that the event on July 18th was performed without any playbill at all, there being no printing press aboard, no time and probably no necessity, for this was an “in-house” occasion.  What is clear is that the same actors (the part of Richard in Raising the Wind yet unallocated) performed these plays later (the spaces suggesting time and date yet to be decided) to the general public. Such a performance would have occurred during the decommissioning of Bellerophon at HM Dockyard Chatham. This took place immediately after her last service as interim transport for Napoleon and prior to her final service as a prison ship.  \r\n\r\nThe playbill, apart from being material evidence of the civil behaviour extended to Napoleon even in defeat, stands as a robust reminder of the great attention the Royal Navy has always paid to the maintenance of good public relations when in port.\r\n\r\nFor more on the discovery of the playbill, see Further Information\r\n",

                "text": "The discovery of this unique event\r\n\r\nOf the four Justice relatives who served (and survived) as officers in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars, it is Francis Wall Justice to whom we owe the discovery of this heretofore unknown episode in the story of Napoleon’s final journey to St. Helena.  \r\n\r\nAlthough much of the Justice family’s archival materials were lost in the bombing of Portsmouth in late 1940, the midshipman’s journals of F. W. Justice, then just 19 years old and serving aboard HMS Bellerophon, survived.  Leafed into the journal that describes that period, was a playbill headed “Theatre-Royal, H.M.S. Bellerophon”. On it is listed the characters and cast for each play with Mr. Justice playing “Doctor Ollapod” in the Colman and “Plainway” in the Kenney. \r\n\r\nWritten by hand above the heading is “Performed before Bonaparte on board-----------” and on the reverse, “Bill of the Play performed before Bonaparte on board the Belleophon”; under the last word, the date “1815”.  The ink used has been examined and found to be of the same kind as that used by Mr. Justice for his journal entries and certainly, the handwriting is identical to the writing in the journal. \r\n\r\nIt may be of interest that Francis Wall Justice after joining the navy at age 13 was one of a select few who remained with the Royal Navy after the end of the Napoleonic Wars.  He served with the South Atlantic Squadron working as a cartographer for those sea roads and coasts and retiring into Somerset with the rank of Commander.",

                "text": "This letter was sent from the HMS Bellerophon’s  assistant surgeon Ephraim Graebke to his mother and recounts in detail Napoleon’s arrival on board, and his daily routine on the crossing to Britain. Although the Bellerophon had arrived in Plymouth 26th July, it was kept isolated, with the crew forced to remain on board and no private letters were allowed to be sent from the ship until 30th July.\r\n\r\nIn order to cram as much information as possible into the letter, Graebke wrote both vertically and horizontally, a common technique at the time for saving paper. Thanks to his letter, we know what Napoleon was eating on board and we also have more information about the shipboard theatricals put on for his entertainment (see entry for 18th July). We can only imagine the comic effect of the female dresses which were ‘badly suited for Midshipmen’. His description of the scene in Plymouth Sound is very close to the scene depicted in a print of the period (see the link bottom left to 'Bonaparte on board the Bellerophon off Plymouth' (1816).\r\n\r\nDespite being ‘imprisoned’ on the ship, unable to leave and land in port until arrangements had been made for Napoleon to be transferred to the Northumberland for transportation to the Island of Saint Helena, Graebke nevertheless felt himself ‘very lucky to belong to the old Bellerophon at this important time’.\r\n\r\nFor a transcription of the letter, see Further Information\r\n\r\nWith thanks to Christopher Justice and the other Scruffy Ruffians for suggesting Graebke's letter as an object\r\n",

                "text": "Transcription\r\n\r\nHMS Bellerophon, Plymouth Sound, Tuesday, July 30th, 1815\r\nMy dear Mother,\r\nYou will be surprised at not hearing from me and knowing the Bellerophon’s arrival in England, but when I tell you no private letters were allowed to leave the ship before to-day, that will cease. It’s unnecessary to say that we have got Buonaparte and suite on board, as it was known in England previous to our arrival, which took place on the 24th instant in Torbay. The circumstances which led to his surrender were his defeats in all points, and was it not for the strict blockade we kept up would have escaped to America. We heard of his being on board the French frigate Saale off Rochefort, from which moment we watched his movements if possible more closely than before. On the morning of the 14th instant, observing a schooner bearing a flag of truce on board standing towards us, we hove to for her, when Count Lascazas and General Lallemande came on board with proposals from Buonaparte, in consequence of which we came to anchor in the evening in the roads off Rochelle. Next morning, 15th instant, at 4 A.M. observed a man-of-war brig standing out and beating towards us, we immediately dispatched all our boats. Lieut. Mott in the barge brought Buonaparte on board at 7, the boats were busily employed in bringing his retinue and baggage, and I never saw men exert themselves so much as ours did that day, lest Admiral Hotham should take him, as he was off the harbour in the Superb, and saw him coming on board here, and did all in his power to get in, but did not come to anchor before 11 in the forenoon. Buonaparte is a fine-looking man, inclined to corpulency, is five feet six inches in height, his hair turning grey, and a little bald on the crown of the head, no whiskers, complexion French yellow, eyes grey, Roman nose, good mouth and chin, neck short, big belly, arms stout, small white hands, and shews a good leg. He wears a cocked hat somewhat like our old-fashioned three cornered ones, with the tricoloured cockade in it, plain green coat, cape red, and cuffs the same, plain gold epaulets and a large star on the left breast, white waist-coat and breeches and white silk stockings, thin shoes and buckles. Eats but two meals in the day, breakfast and dinner, and these are sumptuous, fish, flesh, and fowl, wines, fruit, various French dishes &c. &c. He breakfasts about eleven and dines at six, is about half an hour at each, when he generally comes on deck or goes into the after-cabin to study. We do not know what’s to be done with him yet, he remains on board until we hear from the allies. In his suite are Marshal Bertrand, Duc de Rovigo once the French minister of police, Counts Lascazas and Montholon, Generals Lallemande and Gourgou, several Lieut.-Colonels and Captains, to enumerate them would be tedious. We have 33 on board, 17 were sent on board the Myridon, Captn. Gambier. There are two Countesses on board, but not to be compared even to our English ladies. Their children are handsome... We performed the comedy of the ‘Poor Gentleman’ before Buonparte and suite. I acted the part of Corporal Foss. It went off very well, our scenery was excellent. The female dresses were badly suited for Midshipmen. I long to hear from you and will expect to hear all the news... I wish you were all here to see Buonaparte, the curiosity of all ranks to see him is excessive. There are Admiralty orders not to allow any person whatever on board, but they crown in boats round the ship and he very condescendingly stands looking at them through a spyglass. There are two frigates, one on each side of us, the Eurotas and Liffey, and their boats are constantly rowing about the ship to keep off the boats. We prisoners have no other amusement to look at them contending for places. I hope we will soon be allowed to go ashore, as I want to see Captain Sandys. You must be tired reading this long epistle. We took some prizes, one ship laden with Buonaparte’s soldiers, one chasse maree laden with resin, and the Cephalus man-of-war brig sent in a West Indiaman laden with sugar, coffee, &c. from Martinique bound to France, and for which we will share by mutual agreements. Give my affectionate love to Ally, Anne, Wilhelmina, Sophia and Jane. I know the want of not being near them as my shirts are going to pieces, as soon as I can afford the sum I will get some new ones. I have the old number the same as when I left you and bought none since... I remain, my dear mother, your affectionate son,\r\nEphraim Graebke\r\nP.S. I think myself very lucky to belong to the old Bellerophon at this important time. Lose no time in answering this letter.\r\n\r\nMrs Graebke, Midleton, Co. Cork\r\n",

                "text": "In the euphoria that followed Waterloo the British government was initially enthusiastic about memorialising the nation’s fallen soldiers. However, concerns with costs and growing popular unrest in the post-war period meant that its plans for commemorating the battle failed to eventuate. The first official monument to the wars to be completed, the Marble Arch, was not constructed until 1828 and was designed principally as a ceremonial gateway to Buckingham palace in honour of King George IV.\r\n\r\nThis ‘Waterloo’ jug is an example of how the battle was nonetheless spontaneously commemorated in everyday British life. Produced in 1815 in Staffordshire, and currently held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the jug is an early version of prattware, a form of porcelain in which a coloured relief decoration was painted underneath a glaze. \r\n\r\nThe image shows a British light cavalry soldier leaping over a French artillery piece while attacking the scattered crew with his sabre. While the nationalism of the scene is curiously muted, and the cavalryman’s blue uniform resembles that of Dutch or Prussian cavalry who fought alongside the British at Waterloo, the scene captures the excitement and decisiveness of allied victory. \r\n\r\nCommemorating the battle through depiction of a common soldier and in an everyday item, the jug reflects a cultural memory of the Napoleonic Wars as a people’s war rather than a dynastic conflict of the eighteenth century.\r\n",

                "text": "In 1857, the monthly newspaper Willis’s Current Notes dedicated an article to ‘the most curious’ journey of one of Napoleon’s chairs to the parish of Crail in Fifeshire, Scotland. This seat was said to have accompanied the Emperor in his exiles, and to have been ‘commonly used’ by him in Saint Helena. \r\n\r\nWhilst in possession of the local vicar, the chair was sketched and described as being ‘made of a very indifferent piece of mahogany; the stuffed seat and cushion at the back being covered with chintz’.\r\n\r\nThis seemingly banal object, banal at least in nature, unravels the imperial route of domestic trophies of war following Napoleon’s abdication. An East India Company officer, Captain Barclay, had bought it from Saul Solomon, a Saint Helena entrepreneur, who was in possession of many objects belonging to the Emperor, following a local auction in 1921. \r\n\r\nAfter its purchase, Barclay had taken it ‘to Calcutta, and there presented it to his friend, Mr Cudbert Thornhill Glass, EICCS, who [had] sent it to his father, the late Colonel Glass, of Abby Park, Saint Andrews, under the care of Major Burns, son of the poet Robert Burns’. \r\n\r\nLittle is known about how this seat had been utilised during its voyage, whether as a relic or indeed a chair. The Major nevertheless recorded that ‘the chair caused a great sensation on its homeland passage’ and that ‘a Frenchman on board fell down before it and kissed it’. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of Colonel Glass, the object was acquired by his son-in-law, the Revd Merson, in Crail, which suggests the role of the British Empire in the dissemination of Napoleonic objects throughout the world. This object is a powerful reminder of the global resonance of the Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath.\r\n",

The forces which had opposed the British (who were aided by 3 French ships sent from Martinique, the Actéon, the Messager and the Diligent) were defeated. \r\nIn the course of July 1815, news of Napoleon’s defeat had started to filter through and was confirmed when news from Europe, and in particular the Barbados Gazette, which outlined the events of June, arrived in Pointe-à-Pitre on 7 August 1815. The Martinique Gazette also arrived detailing Napoleon’s defeat. \r\nA section of the French troops, in particular the National Guard and the militia decided not to fight for a lost cause against an enemy superior in number.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Governor, the comte de Linois and his deputy baron de Boyer-Peyreleau had decided to oppose the British. These Bonapartists refused to believe the news, especially given that it was brought by the British. They hoped the rumours were false.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night of 5-6 July, the British landed 300 men on the island of Les Saintes; on 18th they seized the island of Marie-Galante, raised the British flag and demanded that the inhabitants swear loyalty to the King of England.\r\n\r\nOn 3 August, Captain Hay came to the town of Basse-Terre to offer it the “protection” of the British army and to order the garrison to put down their arms and make themselves prisoners to be sent to France. This proposition was immediately refused.\r\n\r\nGuadeloupe was attacked on the morning of 8 August. After putting up feeble resistance, the troops, under the command of the Governor and his deputy, were surrounded in the mountains. On the evening of 9 August, the Count de Linois sent an envoy to the British general to ask for his conditions.\r\n\r\nThe surrender, today’s document, occurred on 10 August 1815. It settled Franco-British combats in the French Caribbean once and for all.\r\n\r\nTo read the original entry in French see Further Information\r\n",

A la suite d’une faible résistance les troupes dirigées par le gouverneur et son adjoint furent encerclées sur les hauteurs de l’île. Le 9 août au soir, le comte de Linois envoya un parlementaire au général anglais pour lui demander ses conditions. \r\nLa capitulation objet du document, eut lieu le 10 août 1815. Il met définitivement un point final aux combats franco-britanniques dans les Antilles françaises. \r\n",

                "text": "On July 15, 1815, Napoleon left Rochefort, the French Atlantic port where he had taken refuge after Waterloo, and surrendered to Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland of the 74-gun HMS Bellerophon. The vessel then sailed to Britain. It anchored off Brixham and Torbay (Devon) on July 24, and reached Plymouth on July 26. \r\n\r\nThe exact terms by which Napoleon was received on board the Bellerophon and the nature of his conversation with Maitland still remain uncertain to this day. While Napoleon would argue until the end of his life that he had voluntarily come on board the ship, in the belief that its captain would offer him political asylum in Britain, Maitland always claimed that he had stated clearly that he was not authorized to make any promise of this sort. \r\n\r\nWhile the British government was trying to reach a decision about what to do with its prisoner, the ship was anchored in Plymouth harbor, where it would remain for two weeks. \r\n\r\nThis painting, entitled Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815 (1816), by the Swiss John James Chalon (1778-1854), represents HMS Bellerophon (centre), surrounded by small boats loaded with onlookers. \r\n\r\nNapoleon’s presence off the English coast aroused the curiosity of thousands of people, from all social ranks. The same scene had occured in Brixham and Torbay. Were the spectators merely fascinated by a celebrity (and what a celebrity!) whom they could see in the flesh, or, was it, as some radicals hoped and the government feared, a sign of a deeper political sympathy among the British public for democratic ideas? \r\n\r\nOn August 4, the Bellerophon left Plymouth, and on the 7th, Napoleon was transferred to HMS Northumberland, which would transport him to Saint-Helena. \r\n",

Parry, like Wordsworth, was an Inspector of Stamps and had stayed with the poet at his home Rydal Mount. The drawing was made while the defeated French Emperor was a prisoner on board HMS Bellerophon at Plymouth, before his exile to St. Helena. \r\n\r\nThe original had been drawn by Napoleon's chamberlain and Parry, who was on a ship moored next to the Bellerophon, traced this copy and sent it to Wordsworth, who preserved it.\r\n \r\nWordsworth had followed Napoleon’s career since its earliest stages, making Bonaparte the subject of his first mature sonnet in 1802, lamenting that the Corsican’s military upbringing was not the education required for ‘the Governor who must be wise and good'. In December 1804 he described the First Consul's coronation as emperor as ‘the dog returning to its vomit’ and after the Napoleon’s fall at Waterloo declared that ‘My whole soul was with those who were resolved to fight it out with Bonaparte’. \r\n\r\nWordsworth’s response to Napoleon, and the war more generally, is the subject of the Wordsworth Museum exhibition, ‘Wordsworth, War & Waterloo’, in Grasmere until 1stNovember 2015.\r\n",
